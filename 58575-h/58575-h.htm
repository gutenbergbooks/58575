<h2>
INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p>
Ordinarily events are the result of antecedent
causes, but now and then an apparently fortuitous
incident upsets all calculations and changes the
course of history in a day. Of such a character
was the discovery of gold in California. It would
be difficult to overstate its importance. It led
directly to a similar discovery in Australia and the
combined output of the two fields replenished the
world's stock of precious metals, shaped monetary
systems, stimulated prices and powerfully affected
the economic and industrial development of the
last half century. Politically for the United States
the discovery was the turning point in the struggle
between the sections. Texas had been annexed and
the South West wrung from Mexico largely for
the purpose of equalizing slave and free territory
by providing the South with an outlet for Western
emigration comparable in extent with that possessed
by the North. The instantaneous settlement
of California under circumstances unfavorable to
slavery produced a free state and gave the North
a majority in the Senate. The attempt to recover
the lost ground brought on the Kansas struggle and
precipitated the war that destroyed the only real
cause of antagonism between the sections. Socially
the results of the discovery were not less important.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
Immediately a new state was added to the Union.
Ultimately the necessity of joining the new state
to the older ones opened the West to settlement,
built the trans-continental railways, reclaimed the
desert and peopled the continent. Fifty years ago
Congress was petitioned to import "thirty camels
and twenty dromedaries" and their use as a means
of crossing the Western deserts was seriously discussed
in books and newspapers.<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> Today there is
no part of this vast territory that is not within
easy reach of the railroad. Of the remarkable
things accomplished in the United States perhaps
the most remarkable is the rapid movement of population
from seaboard to seaboard, and yet this
movement has been strangely neglected by historians.
They follow minutely the course of Coronado
and Radisson but know little of J. S. Smith
and scarcely take the trouble to trace the routes of
even so famous an explorer as John C. Fremont.
They devote much space to the difficulties of settling
Jamestown and Plymouth and very little to
the hardships of the overland journey. They carefully
trace the campaigns of the War of 1812 but
barely mention the wars that have won the continent
from the Indians. As throwing a side-light
upon one phase of this neglected movement Audubon's
"Journal" is presented to the public. But
quite apart from this, the book is interesting as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
human document. Not only does it reflect the
energy and strength of character of the author but
the glimpse it gives of the constancy of the greater
part of his companions and of man's humanity to
man under the most trying circumstances strengthens
faith in the essential soundness of human
nature.
</p>

<p>
The Californian discovery was made in January
of 1848. Wildly exaggerated rumors of what had
been found reached the Eastern states by the middle
of the following September. Official reports
were received in Washington in time for mention
in the President's annual message of December 5.
The rush to California had already begun. As the
continent could not be crossed in the winter, the
earliest to start went by water. Large numbers
embarked upon the long and dreary voyage around
the Horn or rushed to Panama and Nicaragua to
take ship from the Pacific seaports. As the spring
opened, crowds collected at Independence, Missouri,
ready to begin the overland journey in May,
which was as early as it was safe to start. There
were two overland routes from this point. The
northern one followed the Oregon Trail to Fort
Hall and from there crossed by way of the Humboldt
River and over the Sierra Nevadas to California.
The southern route followed the Santa
Fé Trail to Santa Fé, where the emigrants divided,
a part taking the "Old Spanish Trail" to the north
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
and a part General Kearny's route along the Gila
on the south. While some of the emigrants went
as individuals, by far the larger number went in
companies. Stock was subscribed to meet
expenses, often by men who did not go in person,
and the companies were organized for mutual assistance
and defense. The company which Mr.
Audubon joined was financed by his friends, the
Kingslands, and was to be led by Col. Henry L.
Webb. Colonel Webb, a New Yorker by birth,
had joined the volunteers from Illinois at the outbreak
of the Mexican war, and later had been promoted
to the command of a regiment. Having
served in Mexico, he knew something of the country.
Partly for this reason but chiefly no doubt
in order to get an earlier start, the company was
to take the Mexican route. The wisdom of the
choice might have been vindicated but for the loss
of life and the delay caused by the cholera. This
scourge was not, however, confined to the southern
routes. Carried up by the river boats to Independence,
it attacked the emigrants before leaving on
their journey and, pursuing them to the mountains,
lined the roads across the plains with newly made
graves.
</p>

<p>
Leaving New York, February 8, 1849, with
about eighty men and a capital of $27,000, Mr.
Audubon proceeded by water to Philadelphia and
Baltimore, took the railroad to Cumberland and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
thence crossed the Alleghanies by stage to Brownsville
and Pittsburg. Here the company took a
river boat for Cairo, where they were joined by
Colonel Webb. Changing boats they descended
the Mississippi to New Orleans, which they
reached February 18, ten days after leaving New
York. After some time spent here in the purchase
of supplies, they took a boat for Brazos at the
mouth of the Rio Grande. From Brazos they
were carried up the Rio Grande to a point opposite
Rio Grande City, where they landed on the tenth
of March. Here they were attacked by the cholera
and ten men succumbed to the dread disease.
To add to their distress, the company's money was
stolen and only after great difficulty was a part
of it recovered. Discouraged by disease and misfortune,
twenty of the men turned back. Then
Colonel Webb deserted his company, the men at
the same time refusing to go on under his leadership.
For a time it seemed that the journey would
be abandoned but about half of the men asked Mr.
Audubon to lead them and bound themselves to
go on under his command. More than a month
was required for reorganization and for the recovery
of the sick, so that it was not until April 28
that the start was really made. They were now
as late as the emigrants who started by the northern
routes, and were further from their goal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Leaving the Rio Grande at Roma, the company
took the main road to Chihuahua, passing through
Monterey, Saltillo, Buena Vista, Parras, and Mapimi
and reaching Parral June 18. Cholera still
followed them and here claimed another victim.
Mr. Audubon had been twice attacked but had
been able to resist the disease. At Parral the company
left the highway and struck across the mountains
to Sonora. On the western slope towns were
few and far between. Ures was reached August
22 and Altar September 9. Leaving Altar they
entered a desert inhabited only by Indians living
on lizards and grasshoppers. At the Pima villages
on the Gila they reached the line of General
Kearny's march, which had become the southern
emigrant route. The march through the Gila valley
to the Colorado proved the most trying part
of the journey. With supplies for the men
exhausted, without grass for the mules, and with
little water for either, the limit of endurance was
almost reached. Crossing the Colorado, the company
turned northward through the desert to the
mountain passes and then southward to San Diego,
whence they followed the trail to Los Angeles.
Here Mr. Audubon decided to send the greater
part of the company to San Francisco by sea, while
he, with ten of the men, drove the mules through
by land. Crossing the coast range the route now
followed the Tulare valley and the San Joaquin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
River to Stockton. At San Francisco the company
was reunited and from here started for a tour of
the southern mines. Finding that they were
already crowded and that the first fruits had been
gathered, Mr. Audubon turned with his friend
Layton to the northern mines. The two proceeded
to Sacramento and thence to Coloma and Georgetown,
where the journal suddenly stops. The trip
was probably interrupted at this point and Mr.
Audubon called back to San Francisco to make
preparations for his return home.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the whole of this long journey Mr.
Audubon took notes of scenes and occurrences by
the way. In his descriptions he exhibits the keen
observation of the naturalist and the trained eye
of the artist. The result is a remarkable picture of
social conditions in Mexico, of birds and trees, of
sky and mountains and the changing face of nature,
of the barrenness of the desert and the difficulties
of the journey, of the ruined missions of California,
of methods of mining, and of the chaos of races
and babel of tongues in the gold fields. It was
manifestly impossible to keep a daily journal, and
the entries were made from time to time as opportunity
occurred. Considering the circumstances
under which they were taken, the notes are remarkable
for their accuracy. It was Mr. Audubon's
intention to rewrite and to publish them in ten
parts. One part was printed privately and given
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
to a few friends but distractions at home prevented
the continuance of the work. The notes were
taken in a series of little books from which they
have been faithfully transcribed by his daughter.
The only omissions are a few personal references,
which form no essential part of the narrative and
which she has thought best not to print. A few
corrections have been made in the orthography
of common words which were misspelled as a
result of the haste in which they were written.
Where names of places and Spanish words were
spelled phonetically, the correct forms have been
enclosed in brackets or given in notes at the places
where they first occur. In all essential respects the
notes are printed exactly as they were left by their
author. Many of the names of places are names
of haciendas and ranchos, some of which could not
be identified. Of those identified, there is some
variation in spelling upon the Mexican maps of
the period. A few notes have been added chiefly
in explanation of personal references in the text.
The great bulk of Mr. Audubon's sketches was
lost. A few of those that were saved have been
reproduced and a portrait of Mr. Audubon, taken
in 1853, has been added, together with a map of
his route.

<h2>
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
</h2>

<p class="post">
John Woodhouse Audubon, the younger of the
two sons of John James Audubon and his wife,
Lucy Bakewell, was born in Henderson, Kentucky,
November 30, 1812. Those who recall the life of
the ornithologist may remember that at this time
he was far from his days of prosperity, and was
trying to be a business man, with saw-mills and
lumber; a venture, which like all his business
efforts, did not succeed. Therefore, almost before
the boy John remembered, the wandering days
began for him, which continued virtually all his
life. During his boyhood these wanderings were
chiefly confined to that portion of the United
States south of the Ohio River, and largely to
Louisiana, a section of country he always loved.
</p>

<p>
As a child, though small and slender, he was
strong and active and delighted in the open air life
which was indeed his second nature; and he was
proficient in swimming, shooting, fishing and all
out-door sports and pleasures, while still a boy.
He was rather averse to the needful studies which
kept him from the woods and streams, but which
his mother never permitted him to neglect. She
was, herself, the teacher of her sons in their earlier
years, and a most thorough one, as later generations
can testify, sending them to school only when she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
realized that they needed contact with boys of
their own age; but the home education was never
given up. Both she and Mr. Audubon were
excellent musicians, great readers, and most
desirous that their children should be prepared,
as fully as possible, to enter the world as educated,
and even accomplished men. Drawing was an
important matter always, and both sons, Victor
and John, became well skilled in this art, but in
different lines, the first in landscape, the second in
delineating birds and quadrupeds—or as the
scientists say today, mammals—the latter being
his specialty, though the first intention was that he
should be a portrait painter.
</p>

<p>
The boys while children were usually together,
and were sent to school at the same time, though
Victor was three years the elder, but at times they
were separated. Victor was a quiet, studious boy,
and a great favorite with the elder members of his
mother's family, the Bakewells, while John, who
was full of mischief, very restless, always most
successful in getting his young cousins as well as
himself into all sorts of scrapes, was naturally less
in demand. When Mr. and Mrs. Audubon were
wandering from place to place, Victor was frequently
with relatives in Louisville, and at an
early age became a clerk in the office of Mr.
Nicholas Berthoud, who had married a sister of
Mrs. Audubon. He was in this position when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
his father sailed for England in 1826, while John
remained in Louisiana with his mother at Bayou
Sara, where she was then teaching.
</p>

<p>
At this period of his life John spent much time
drawing from nature, and playing the violin, of
which he was passionately fond all his life. While
his father was pushing the publication of "The
Birds of America" in England and Scotland, he
at one time supplemented the slender finances of
the family, in a small way, by taking occasional
trips on the Mississippi river steamboats as a clerk.
It was very uncongenial work to the restless youth,
and, from what can be learned, was rather indifferently
done; but he was a great favorite with all
with whom he came in contact, and usually found
some one to help him over his mistakes, and indeed
on occasion to do his work, while he, with his violin
was in great demand on the decks of the steamboats,
in those days scenes of much gaiety, some of
which was of more than doubtful quality. After a
comparatively short season of mingled work and
play, Mrs. Audubon withdrew him from what
Louisianians called "the river," and he returned to
his work in painting and in collecting specimens
which his father wanted for the various friends and
scientists with whom he was now constantly in
touch.
</p>

<p>
The elder Audubon upon his return from
Europe took the family, after a few weeks in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
Louisiana, further north, and they were some time
in the vicinity of Philadelphia and New York. In
1830 the two brothers were left in America while
Mr. and Mrs. Audubon were in England and
France, and again John tried his hand at clerkship
with better success than in his earlier years, but
not for long.
</p>

<p>
On his return to America Mr. Audubon made
plans for a summer in Labrador and in 1833 made
this journey, John with three other young men
accompanying him. The days were not only long,
but arduous. John was not quite twenty-one, and
his love of fun was as strong as in his boyhood, but
he found none in being called at three in the
morning to search for birds, being frequently
drenched to the skin all day, and working with
bird skins through "the interminable twilights."
Nevertheless he and his young companions found
time to rob salmon preserves when the fishermen
would not sell, to slip on land when opportunity
offered, to attend some of the very primitive balls
and other amusements to be found on these desolate
shores, and to extract pleasures which perhaps
youth alone could have found among such surroundings.
</p>

<p>
So passed the years taking boyhood and youth
with them until 1834, when the Audubon family
all went to England and Scotland, where both
young men painted very steadily, making copies of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
many of the celebrated pictures within reach of
which they now found themselves. At this time
John confined himself almost wholly to copying
portraits, principally those of Sir Thomas Lawrence,
whose friendship was most valuable to him,
of Van Dyke and Murillo, and, when in Edinburgh,
giving great attention to the beautiful work
of Sir Henry Raeburn. Some of these early pictures
are still in the possession of the family,
though many were sold and many given away.
He also painted some water colors of birds, which
are said to be good work by those who know them.
</p>

<p>
This period of study was broken, however, by a
trip to the continent taken by the brothers together.
The route followed was the one then called "The
Grand Tour," extending as far as Italy. The
brothers, always most closely united, congenial in
thoughts and tastes, thoroughly enjoyed the novel
scenes and experiences, for which they were well
fitted both physically and mentally. They were tall,
handsome young men, full of health and strength,
and the joyousness of youth. The careful preparation
in the reading of books of travel and literature,
and the fact that they were excellent French scholars,
added greatly to the interest of the journey.
</p>

<p>
But busier days than these were in store, when
the Audubons returned to America, and the collection
of new species demanded the attention of the
naturalist, and the assistance of his sons. Victor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
attended to most of the business details, partly in
England and partly in America, while my father
and grandfather searched the woods, and in 1836
went as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. It was
at the beginning of this trip that, passing through
Charleston, a visit was paid to the home of Dr.
John Bachman, and the attachment began between
my father and Maria Bachman, which resulted in
their marriage in 1837.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after John and his young wife went to
England, where his father had again gone to superintend
the continued publication of the plates in
London, and here their first child, Lucy, was born.
Six months later, John with his wife and child
returned to America. The next two years were
spent partly in New York, partly in the south, in
the vain hope of finding health and strength for the
delicate young mother, but all was unavailing, and
she died leaving two little daughters, one an infant.
Later John Audubon married an English lady,
Caroline Hall, and to them seven children were
born, five of whom lived to maturity.
</p>

<p>
At this time the country place on the Hudson
river near New York City, which had been bought
in 1840, was built upon. Today it is well nigh
lost in the rapidly advancing streets and avenues,
but at this time it was almost primitive forest, and
here for some years lived the naturalist and his
wife, with the two sons and their respective families.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
It is hard today to picture the surroundings
of that time. No railroad cut off the waters of
the lovely river, then the highway from the ocean
to Albany, and alive with craft of many kinds.
The other three sides were heavily wooded; and
neighbors there were none, for it was not until
some years later that other homes began slowly to
appear here and there. Few if any of the friends
of the Audubons in those days are left on earth, and
the houses where they once lived have, with few
exceptions, either been torn down or so altered that
their former owners would not recognize them.
</p>

<p>
Minniesland with its large gardens and orchards,
especially celebrated for peaches, its poultry yards
and dairy which added to the comfort of the home
and of the many guests who always found a welcome
there, had an interesting side in the elk, deer,
moose, foxes, wolves and other wildwood creatures
which were kept for study and pleasure; and still
another in the books, pictures and curios within
the ever hospitable house, but more than all was
the charm of the tall gray-haired old man, who
by talent, industry, and almost incredible perseverance
won it for those he loved.
</p>

<p>
The early days at Minniesland were very happy
ones for all. The "Quadrupeds of North America"
had been begun and was of intense interest to father
and sons, and the work he was doing for this
publication, the superintendence of the animal life
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
about the home, the varied enjoyments and duties
of the country place gave my father ample occupation.
He loved the Hudson and the Palisades,
the woods and walks about him, was devoted to his
family and these were years he delighted to recall.
</p>

<p>
Many men were employed in one capacity or
another and "Mr. John," as he was always called,
was a great favorite. He had the rare gift of
keeping these men friends, while he was perfectly
understood to be the master; they were thoroughly
at home with him, yet never familiar, and this
position, so difficult to maintain, he held with all.
As the village of Manhattanville, a little lower
down the river, grew in size, many of the men from
there used to walk up on summer evenings to help
"haul the seine;" for fish were plentiful and good
in the Hudson then; and where "Mr. John" was,
disturbance or insolence was unknown, his orders
to each man were respected, his division of fish
always satisfied.
</p>

<p>
An interruption in this tranquil life came in 1843
when Audubon the elder went to the Yellowstone
country, and both sons were anxious about their
father until his return; they felt that he was too old
for such an arduous journey, but he was determined
to go, and his safe return ended all alarm for his
safety. Another break came in 1845 when my
father went to Texas to find mammals to depict in
the new work being published, and possibly birds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
not yet described. He took with him as sole
companion of his travels James B. Clement, one
of the men about the place, in whom he had—and
most justly—perfect confidence. He was in
Texas many months, travelling quite extensively,
and at a time when the Indians were not friendly.
Even more danger might be apprehended from the
white men of desperate character, who had drifted
to that region either to escape punishment for
previous crimes, or to find themselves so far from
law and order that they could commit fresh ones
in safety. It was on this trip that my father met
Colonel Hays, well known then as "Jack Hays the
Texan Ranger," between whom and himself a
strong friendship was formed, and to whom my
father felt much indebted; as, knowing the country
so well, Colonel Hays gave him valuable aid in
choosing routes, selecting Indians as guides and
hunters, and in avoiding camps and settlements
where he would certainly have been robbed, and
possibly murdered, had he offered to protect his
possessions, for at that time all money had to be
carried in coin.
</p>

<p>
Upon this journey my father was very successful
in securing specimens. When he returned he
brought one of his hunters, a half-breed Indian
named Henry Clay, a name which had probably
been given to him in jest. This man was my
father's shadow; he was very skillful in the care of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
the animals, a splendid boatman and fisherman and
very valuable about the place. But civilization
was too wearisome for him, he left two or three
times and came back, but about 1852 returned to
Texas with Captain McCown.<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
In 1846, the year following the Texan journey,
John Audubon with his wife and children went to
Europe, in order that he might paint pictures—still
for the "Quadrupeds"—from some of the
specimens he could find only in the zoological
collections of London, Paris and Berlin, and he
was absent on this work more than a year and a
half. It was a period of most arduous work; his
letters home were very short, though he was an easy
and rapid writer. The reason for this brevity
was, as he often explains, that his arm and hand
were tired with the long days of steady painting;
particularly when the fur of the animals he was
delineating was of unusual length, for this was
before the days of "dabs and smudges" and minuteness
of detail was insisted on both by the elder
Audubon and by the engravers. These were long
months to him as most of them were passed in
crowded cities, where he missed the forests and
rivers, his home and the free life to which he was
accustomed. Many times in the letters written
to those at Minniesland, he declares his intention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
of never leaving home again, an intention he was
unable to carry out.
</p>

<p>
In 1849 he joined a California company, being
urged thereto by the Messrs. Kingsland, who were
warm personal friends and who were then backing
Col. Henry L. Webb who had been in Mexico and
advocated that route for the company he was
collecting. My father's idea was that such a journey
offered splendid opportunities to secure specimens
of birds and mammals. It was proposed
that he should give the company his knowledge of
a backwoodsman's life, which was extensive, and
be second in command to Colonel Webb, a responsibility
which he rather hesitated to accept, as he
wished the freedom of leaving the party anywhere
he chose after reaching California. Finally,
however, he signed papers with Messrs. Daniel C.
and Ambrose Kingsland, and Cornelius Sutton,
(Colonel Webb signing also), to stay with the
company for one year, when they expected to reach
their destination and be on the high road to wealth.
</p>

<p>
In Colonel Webb's company the contracts were
individual. The company supplied everything
but the personal belongings of each man and his
horse, and he in return was supposed to repay with
legal interest his share of expenses when he reached
the El Dorado, and to this end his work and his
earnings were the company's for a year from the
time of signing. If when the contracts expired
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
there were any profits, these were to be divided in
a certain ratio. My father's contract was signed
January 31, 1849, and the fact that he was going
induced many of his personal friends and acquaintances
to join also. Almost all the men employed
at Minniesland went with "Mr. John." To the
daughter of one of these, Mrs. Alice Walsh Tone,
I am much indebted for help in names and dates.
</p>

<p>
The journey across the continent in 1849 with
no regular means of communication with home and
friends, through a country virtually unknown, and
when Indians were still numerous; without cities
to enable travelers to get fresh supplies of food and
clothing, and with no very definite knowledge of
the road, was a serious matter under the best of
conditions and on the best route. What it was
with men who, with few exceptions, knew nothing
of the life before them, who were impoverished by
robbery, discouraged by death and disease and
deserted by their leader, upon a route of which
my father never approved, may be best learned
from his "Journal." The journey was a terrible
disappointment to him, as he says: "my arsenic
is broadcast on the barren clay soil of Mexico, the
paper in which to preserve plants was used for
gun-wadding, and, though I clung to them to the
last, my paints and canvases were left on the Gila
desert of awful memories."
</p>

<p>
In July, 1850, he sailed for home, which he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
reached in safety after the delay of a week at the
Isthmus of Panama. Most unfortunately all his
paintings, which were of course sketches to be
worked up from notes, and most of the water colors
he had made, nearly two hundred in all, had to be
left temporarily at Sacramento; later they were
taken to San Francisco and Mr. Robert Simson
took charge of them for a time. He entrusted
them, at my father's request, to Mr. John
Stevens and with that noble man and true friend
they went down in the wreck of the steamer "Central
America."
</p>

<p>
It would be interesting to follow the careers of
those who made the California journey with my
father, but the lapse of fifty-six years makes this
almost impossible, and very few traces of the members
of the party can be found, nor indeed can any
full list of those who left New Orleans with him
be made. James B. Clement remained in Stockton
as did Nicholas Walsh and John H. Tone;
they became fruit growers and were successful in
the land of their adoption. Henry C. Mallory
entered business in San Francisco, married and
lived in that city until his death, now a number of
years ago. Robert Simson died not long since; he
lived for some time in San Francisco, being a
partner in a legal firm, afterwards removing to
Alameda. He married rather late in life, and left a
widow and one son. Langdon Havens returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
to his home at Fort Washington and many others
also came back to the east. The greater part of
the company, I believe, remained upon the Pacific
Slope; but I have been unable to locate them or
their descendants, except in the few instances I
have mentioned. Though the company proved an
utter failure financially, yet nearly every man
eventually reimbursed the Messrs. Kingsland for
their outlay, and in five instances the friends of
those who died did for them that, which living
they would doubtless have done for themselves.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the California journey my father
was thirty-six, tall, strong and alert though always
slender, keen of vision and hearing, quick in movement
and temperament, and with most tender and
skillful hands as those have testified whom he
nursed in the dreadful cholera days. He had
inherited from his father the gift of making and
keeping friends among all classes, and of giving
them confidence in him—the result of his quick
and deep sympathy, his unselfishness and his absolute
truthfulness. He was never indolent; whatever
work had to be done, his was the hardest part—he
never shirked, never grumbled. As evidence
of this trait of his character I quote from one of his
companions, Lieutenant Browning, whose son has
kindly given me some extracts from his letters:
"Mr. Audubon is always doing somebody's else
work as well as his own;" "Mr. Audubon never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
thinks of himself, I never knew such a big-hearted
man." I will touch on only one other characteristic.
He was subject to periods of the deepest
depressions, a trait also inherited from his father,
which sometimes weighed his spirits down for
days, and which it seemed impossible for him to
dispel. Often on this California journey the effort
to appear bright and cheerful when he was in one
of these moods physically exhausted him, and in
some of his letters he speaks of the relief it was
when night came and he was alone, and had no
need to look or be other than he felt. He never
outlived these attacks as the naturalist did, perhaps
because his life was so much shorter.
</p>

<p>
My father's home-coming showed him many sad
changes, for his father was now not only an old
but a broken man, and the spirit of the home was
no longer joyous. Father, mother, and sons had
always been most united, unusually so it seems, as
many incidents and events are recalled. Possibly
this deep affection was the result of the struggles
of early days, which, throwing them so much on
each other for companionship, developed a sympathy
with one another which lives full of separate
interests would not have fostered—possibly the
great similarity of work and tastes drew them
closer to each other than when such conditions do
not exist, but whatever the reason, it is certain that
the ties which held them together were never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
loosened but by death; and so, when in January,
1851, he who had been the light of the home passed
away, the break was most keenly and deeply felt.
</p>

<p>
In 1853 two new houses near the original one,
now grown too small for the many children, were
completed and these Victor and John Audubon
occupied with their families, the mother living
with one son or the other as the spirit moved her.
The continued publication of "The Quadrupeds"
and the octavo edition of "The Birds" occupied
both my uncle and father. The latter reduced all
the large plates of the birds to the desired size by
means of the <i>camera lucida</i>, his delicate and exact
work fitting him for the exquisitely minute details
required. Much of each winter was spent in the
southern states, securing subscribers.
</p>

<p>
In 1853 a great sorrow came in the death of a
little daughter, and soon after even a heavier.
Victor Audubon began to fail in health, the result
of a fall which at the time was thought to be of
no moment, but which had injured the spine.
Through long years it was agony to my father to
witness the constant decline of the brother with
whom his entire life was so intimately associated
and to whom he was so deeply attached. Nothing
could stay the progress of the malady and on the
seventeenth of August, 1860, came the parting
which had so long been dreaded.
</p>

<p>
During this long period of my uncle's illness all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
the care of both families devolved on my father.
Never a "business man," saddened by his brother's
condition, and utterly unable to manage at the
same time a fairly large estate, the publication of
two illustrated works, every plate of which he felt
he must personally examine, the securing of subscribers
and the financial condition of everything—what
wonder that he rapidly aged, what wonder
that the burden was overwhelming! After my
uncle's death matters became still more difficult
to handle, owing to the unsettled condition of the
southern states where most of the subscribers to
Audubon's books resided, and when the open rupture
came between north and south, the condition
of affairs can hardly be imagined, except by those
who lived through similar bitter and painful
experiences.
</p>

<p>
Worn out in body and spirit, overburdened with
anxieties, saddened by the condition of his country,
it is no matter of surprise that my father could not
throw off a heavy cold which attacked him early
in 1862. On the evening of Tuesday, February 18,
he was playing on his violin some of the Scotch airs
of which he was so fond, when suddenly putting
down the instrument he said he had so much fever
he would retire. Before morning delirium set in,
and for two days and nights he wandered in
spirit over the many lands where once in health
and strength the happy boy, the joyous youth, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
earnest man had traveled in body. Especially
was the Californian trip present in his fevered
mind, and incidents and scenes were once more
vividly before him, until on the twenty-first he
fell asleep never to awaken here, and, as the stormy
night closed in, almost at the same hour as that on
which his father died, he too took the last journey
and entered into that unknown land, and was "forever
free from storm and stress." His forty-nine
years of life had been very full ones, he had
touched the extremes of joy and sorrow, he had
known failure and success; like his father he had
never done anything indifferently. His enthusiasm
carried him over many difficulties, his sympathy
and generosity endeared him to every one and,
when the end of the busy life came, there was left
a vacant place, never to be filled, in the hearts of
those who knew and loved him.

<h2>
CHAPTER I
<br />

<span class="s08">
NEW YORK TO TEXAS</span>
</h2>

<p class="post">
A year of quiet at my happy home had passed since
my return from my last voyage to England, when
"the fever" as it was called began to rage in New
York, and as I sat, convalescent from a fever of a
different kind at the time, of more danger than my
present trip, I listened to the tales of speedily
accumulated fortunes. At first I heard them with
complete scepticism, again with less, until in some
degree faith in the tales began to be awakened in
my mind, and at last I thought it might possibly
come to pass that I should go to California; but
still it was very vague, and I scarcely dwelt on the
idea of so long a trip except as a dream. However,
I mentioned it to two or three of my friends asking
what they thought, and answers came, as is always
the case on occasions when advice is asked, so
various, that I was bewildered, and finally I felt I
must come to those in my own home to aid me in my
decision. But even here I was thrown back upon
my own judgment. My noble father could give
me no advice now, but in 1845, when I was in
Texas, he had written to me: "Push on to California,
you will find new animals and birds at
every change in the formation of the country, and
birds from Central America will delight you."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After long talks over the "pros and cons," I
concluded to go for a long eighteen months from
my beloved home, and decided to join "Col. H. L.
Webb's California Company" which was being
organized. I was appointed second in command
owing to my knowledge of backwoodsman's life
and the experience of my Texas trip; and after
eight weeks of weariness and anxiety found I was to
take charge of eighty men and, with $27,000.00
belonging to the Company, was to meet Col. Webb
at Cairo.
</p>

<p>
I had talked with fathers, and with young men
who wished to learn all about a backwoodsman's
life in half an hour, made purchases of arms and
implements and various needful articles, and
finally all was ready, and the date of departure
decided upon.
</p>

<p>
<i>Feb. 8th, 1849.</i> A day of hurry began, and
three o'clock found us on board the steamer
"Transport," surrounded by the company and a
crowd of their friends and ours to see us off.
Fathers took my hands in both theirs, and in
scarcely audible voices begged me to take care of
only sons, brothers asked me to give counsel and
advice to younger brothers, men I had never seen
gave hearty hand clasps that told of sound hearts,
and said: "My brother's with you, treat him
right and if he is <i>my</i> brother he'll die for you, or
with you." The final words of clergymen as they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
gave us their parting advice and blessing, were
drowned by the tolling of the last bell. Its knell
went to my heart like a funeral note, and I was too
much overcome to answer the cheer of the hundreds
who came down to see us off, and in silence waved
my cap to my brother and friends, and in deep
mental sorrow prayed God for courage and ability
to do all I had promised to try to do.
</p>

<p>
My men looked back to New York's beautiful
battery, and I paced the boiler deck almost alone,
watching the red sunset and cooling my burning
face and aching head with the north-west wind,
cold and frosty from the snow covered palisades,
turning often to look up "our North River" to see
if I could get one glimpse of that home so long to
be unseen.
</p>

<p>
The tide was low so we had to take the outside,
and I went to the bow to look over Sandy Hook
towards the broad Atlantic, and to try to realize
that the Pacific had to be seen before I could
again return to my own beautiful coast. It was a
most curious sight as I entered the cabin of the
boat to see the different feelings exhibited; some
were in deep thought; some in sorrowful anxiety;
some gay, and again others with evidently forced
merriment; but in the main, cheerfulness was
certainly on every side, and when I had to announce
that we had been promised what was not on board,
a good supper, not a murmur was heard, and merriment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
was created by the imitations of the orders of
the New York eating-houses such as: "roast beef
rare," "plum pudding both kinds of sauce," etc.
</p>

<p>
Our cabins were not the most comfortable, nor
was the floor of the dining saloon too soft for some
of our city men, but we slept soundly from one
until four; took breakfast at five, and at eight were
driving in the quiet, dignified streets of Philadelphia
towards the Schuylkill. Very cold
weather had followed us, and the heavy northwester
of the day previous retarded our progress
across the Chesapeake from Frenchtown.<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> At
Baltimore we took our luggage at once to the railroad
station, and went to the United States and
Union Hotels, where for a dollar and a quarter
each we had supper, bed and breakfast, and went
off, all in better spirits, for Cumberland, where,
after a miserable dinner and supper combined, we
packed into fourteen stages, having paid nearly an
average of two dollars each for extra luggage,
fifty pounds being the regular allowance for each
man.
</p>

<p>
<i>Feb. 10th.</i> Fortunately we had a full moon,
and as the mountains were all ice and snow it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
"as light as day." Overloaded, and with top-heavy
coaches, as our hind wheels would keep slipping
first on one side, then on the other, to see what the
front ones were doing, it was most extraordinary
we did not capsize, all of us; but no accident
occurred, and at eight next morning we had
descended Laurel Hill on a run, and were slowly
winding the lanes of a more civilized country.
</p>

<p>
As it was Sunday, many cheerful groups, gaily
dressed, ornamented the stoops and sunny sides of
the houses and barns of the contented farmers of
western Pennsylvania, as we passed on to Brownsville,
where we arrived at noon, glad enough to
be safely landed on the banks of the Monongahela.
We reached Pittsburgh at nine the same evening,
went to the Monongahela House and had a comfortable
supper, but as most of our luggage was on
the steamer for Cincinnati, I went on board and
took my berth.
</p>

<p>
Morning came, and after a few kind words from
my relations at Pittsburgh, we left, and had one of
the hundreds of monotonous voyages down the
Ohio that are yearly performed by the steamers.
At Cincinnati I was met by two additional volunteers,
engaged by Col. Webb, and was much
pleased by their appearance, though I should have
preferred seeing backwoodsmen and men who
knew more of the life we were going to lead, but
we must hope on, and trust to Providence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Passages and fares at hotels, etc., included, were
now calculated to see how we had estimated the
cost of each person to Cairo, and we found that for
each one it was one dollar and forty-five cents over
the twenty-five dollars allowed, and I took passages
to the latter place direct, remaining only four hours
at Louisville, where I had the good fortune to find
my uncle W. G. Bakewell waiting for me, and
dined with him while our boat was putting out
some freight at Albany, below the falls. When I
joined my party I was told that some of the men
had stolen a valuable pointer dog, and that a
telegraphic notice had been sent after them; but
on inquiring I found it had been purchased,
no doubt from a thief, so we sent it back from
Cairo.
</p>

<p>
Large flocks of geese and ducks were seen by us
as we made the mouth of the Ohio, and the numbers
increased about Cairo. The ice in the Mississippi
was running so thick that the "J. Q. Adams"
returned after a fruitless effort to ascend the river.
All Cairo was under water, the wharf boat we were
put on, an old steamer, could only accommodate
thirty-five of our party, so that the other thirty had
to be sent to another boat of the same class; the
weather was extremely cold, with squalls of snow
from the north with a keen wind, there was no
plank from our boat to the levee of Cairo, the only
part of the city out of water. Will it be wondered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
at that a slight depression of spirits should for an
instant assail me? But when a man has said he
will do a thing it must be done if life permits, and
in an hour we found ourselves by a red hot stove,
the men provided with good berths for the place,
cheerfulness restored, and after an hour's chat,
while listening to the ever increasing gale outside,
we parted for the night to wake cold, but with good
appetites even for the horrible fare we had, and as
young Kearney Rodgers said, as we looked at the
continents of coffee-stains, and islands of grease
here and there, with lumps of tallow and peaks of
frozen butter on our once white table cloth, "Is it
not wonderful what hunger will bring us to?"
</p>

<p>
Here we found Col. Webb with his wife and
son; I was much pleased with the dignified and
ladylike appearance of Mrs. Webb; once she had
been very beautiful, now she was greatly worn,
and had a melancholy expression, under the circumstances
more appropriate than any other, for
her husband and only son were about to leave her
for certainly eighteen months, and perhaps she was
parting with them for the last time. We chatted
together in rather a forced conversation, until the
"General Scott" for New Orleans came by, and
then went on board paying eight dollars for each
man and five dollars each for Col. Webb's three
horses; so much for Cairo, I don't care ever to see
it again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I found my uncle, W. G. Bakewell, on board
making the trip to New Orleans, and my journey
was as agreeable as it could be, where all my
associations were of a melancholy nature. I
thought of past joys and friends dead and scattered
since the days when I knew this country so well.
</p>

<p>
The river was very high, and the desolation of
the swamps, the lonely decaying appearance of the
clay bluffs, picturesque as they are, added to the
eternal passing on of this mighty stream towards
its doom, to be swallowed in earth's great emblem
of eternity, the ocean, told only of the passing of
all things.
</p>

<p>
<i>February 18th.</i> Four days from Cairo found
us at New Orleans, and a few hours enabled me to
find hotels for our party, and at six o'clock I was
able to tell Col. Webb that I had done all I could
that night and would be with him at nine next
morning, and left for the quiet of my aunt's<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> home.
</p>

<p>
February 19th was spent in running all over
New Orleans, ordering horse and mule shoes,
bacon, flour, bags, tools, ammunition, and making
arrangements to change our certificates of deposit
for such funds as would pass in Mexico. I called
with Col. Webb on General and Mrs. Gaines and
was most kindly received by both, and afterwards
asked to call again, but had no time, as every
minute was occupied with my business.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Two of our men had to be returned from this
place of bars, billiards and thirsty souls, and one of
our otherwise best men was dismissed because he
met some of his old "friends" (?) who would
insist not only on a jovial dinner, but masked balls
and all the other concomitants, and after four days
of this, a unanimous vote of the company expelled
him.
</p>

<p>
Sunday is selected at New Orleans for the departure
of vessels to all parts of the world and at ten
o'clock on the morning of March the 4th, we left
in the steamer "Globe" for Brazos, north of Rio
Grande. We descended the river to the mouth,
but anchored there, as there is a dangerous bar,
and the weather not looking favorable the Captain
of our frail vessel deemed it prudent to wait until
dawn before attempting to go further. We left
our anchorage at daybreak, the cross seas of the
outer bar breaking over the bows at almost every
wave, and I felt that if a real gale came up from the
south-east our trip to California would soon end.
The day continued as it had begun. I went to my
berth and could not have been persuaded that it
was not blowing hard if I had not been able to see
the water from my porthole. The night came on
with a full moon and the trade wind of the Gulf
just fanned a ripple on the old swell to send
millions of sparkling lights in petty imitation of
those spangling the heavens.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Three such nights and four days of hot sun, and
we were running over the bar at Brazos in only
seven or eight feet of water. Not a landmark more
than ten feet high was in sight, but we could see
miles and miles of breakers combing and dashing
on the glaring beach, broken here and there by
dark, weather-stained wrecks of unfortunate vessels
that had found their doom on this desolate
shore.
</p>

<p>
Brazos, like Houston in 1837, is nothing if you
take away what belongs to government, a long flat
a mile wide, extending for a good distance towards
the Rio Grande, is kept out of reach of the sea by a
range of low sand hills, if drifts of eight to ten
or fifteen feet deserve the name; so like those on
all our low shores from Long Island to Florida
that every traveller knows what the island of
Brazos is. The inner bay, however, looking
towards Point Isabel is beautiful, and but for the
extreme heat would have given me a splendid
opportunity for one of my greatest pleasures,
sailing.
</p>

<p>
We found a few cases of cholera had occurred
here, and Major Chapman<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> with the kindness so
generally shown by our officers to their countrymen,
sent off our party at once in the government
steamer "Mentoria." At New Orleans I could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
not insure our money over the bar of the Rio
Grande without an immense premium, so I, with
Biddle Boggs and James Clement, having landed
the horses brought with us, went overland from
Brazos to Brownsville opposite Matamoras, thirty-two
miles, long ones. We took all our money
with us, and started in buoyant spirits. At 10:30,
March 8th, I found myself riding along the beach
of this barren island; for six or eight miles we went
merrily on, watching the little sand-pipers and
turn-stones, and enjoying the invigorating sea-breeze,
as the sun was intensely hot, and when,
from time to time we passed through narrow lanes
of chaparral where the breeze was shut out, and
the dust followed our horses, we were exceedingly
oppressed.
</p>

<p>
We had all seen Texas before, and like sailors
once familiarized with the sea whom an hour restores
to old habits and thoughts, so with the man of
the prairies, and we all felt at home at once. The
country is flat, showing here and there in the distance
some of those bold prominences of clay represented
so beautifully by the Prince de Neuwied in
his wonderful illustrations of the West.<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> These
near the Rio Grande, are, of course, only miniatures
of the "Chateaux blancs" of the northern
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
Mississippi. After our long ride of thirty-two
miles, with only a hard boiled egg each for our
mid-day meal, at three o'clock we reached Brownsville
where the rolling of bowling-alleys and the
cannoning of billiard balls was all that seemed to
enliven the village at that hour. I went to find
the Quartermaster to know where to put our money
for safety, and was most kindly received by Major
Brice<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> who took charge of it and put it in the strong
box at Fort Brown. From this place we had next
morning a fine view of Matamoras, and the American-like
appearance rather startled me from my
old belief of the low standard of all things Mexican,
for it was the only town like a town I had
seen; but I resumed my old opinion when I was
told that all the good houses had been built by
Mr. McGown, who had resided there for years,
and so far I have not seen anything in the shape
of architecture worthy the name, except the old
missions about San Antonio de Bexar.
</p>

<p>
<i>Brownsville, March 8th.</i> Almost a calm this
clear morning, but occasionally a soft breeze, so
gentle as just to wave the white cover of the table
at which I sat. From time to time a distant hammer
sluggishly drove a nail, and the proud cock
was heard to boast his self-importance in a shrill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
crow, the same I have heard from Berlin to this
lonely place; the mocking-birds sang just as they
did in my happiest days in beautiful Louisiana; my
heart went back to my home, and a foreboding of
evil seemed to come over me.
</p>

<p>
Brownsville is one of those little places like
thousands of others in our Southern states; little
work and large profits give an undue share of
leisure without education or refinement, consequently
drinking-houses and billiards with the etc.
are abundant. The river here is narrow and rapid,
and crossed by two ferry-boats swung on hawsers
in the old-fashioned way stretching from bank to
bank of the great "Rio Grande del Norte." They
do a thriving business, as Matamoras contains
many Mexicans who do both a wholesale and
retail "running business," that is, smuggling.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 10th.</i> Col. Webb and the company
came up last evening on the "Mentoria," Captain
Duffield. He stayed over night and after purchasing
a few barrels of rice at about twice its
cost at New Orleans, and one or two little additions
to our already large stock of necessaries, we set
sail in the "Corvette," Captain O'Daniel. Some
time was lost in our progress that night, as we
stuck on the bar just above the town, however we
soon went on, and I found this river quite different
from the usual run of its channel, as after every
rise, which is not often at this season, the channel is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
left full of mud, and the deepest water for a week
or so <i>outside</i> the regular channel.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe any part of this country can be
good for a thing, as the rain is so uncertain in its
favors. The miserable Mexicans, who live far
apart, at distances of ten or even twenty miles
from each other, do not plant their patches of corn
with any certainty that it will mature, the rain failing
to come to fill the ears more frequently than it
comes.
</p>

<p>
The ranchos are forlorn "Jacals" (a sort of openwork
shed covered with skins and rushes and
plastered with mud, here so full of lime and marl
that it makes a hard and lasting mortar), precisely
alike, varying only in picturesqueness of tree or
shrub, or rather shrub alone, for there are no fine
trees here, though the musquit<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> and willow sometimes
arrive at the height of twenty or twenty-five
feet, and back from the river the hackberry attains
a tolerable size.
</p>

<p>
A tall reed of rank growth in thickets, and in
other places a dwarf willow in patches like the
young cottonwoods along the banks of the Mississippi,
are the chief growth.
</p>

<p>
The water is warm, and so full of lime as to
create, rather than allay thirst; what but necessity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
could ever have induced settlers to remain here I
can not tell, for the whole trip from Brownsville
to Camp Ringgold<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> does not present one even
tolerable view; and the most pleasing sight to us
was our own bright flag, one minute fluttering in
a southeast breeze, then gently falling to its rough
flag-staff, and again, five minutes after, blowing
furiously from the northwest, so changeable are
the winds; we hoisted our flag in return, and came
to, just under Major Lamotte's<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> tent.
</p>

<p>
Col. Webb went in to see him alone, to induce
him to allow us to go as far as Roma, but it
appeared that Major Chapman had given orders
to the contrary, as our boat was so large that her
return would be doubtful, so we were taken only
two miles further up the river, and put out on the
Mexican side, on a sandbar, opposite Rio Grande
City. It was two o'clock, the sun pouring down
on us, the mercury 98 degrees in the shade, nevertheless
with all our winter blood in us, we had to
unload our heavy luggage. Casks of government
tents and camp equipage, which we were obliged
to roll sixty or seventy yards through mud and
sand, was hard work. This began to tell the tale.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
The good men went at it with a will, the dandies
looked at their hands, touched a bacon barrel,
rubbed their palms together, looked again, and put
on gloves; but it would not do, and out of our ninety-eight
men, only about eighty were at their work
with good will and cheerful hearts, but all was
soon done, and I gave a sort of melancholy glance
at the "Corvette" as she started off. The Captain
had been very kind to us and we gave him three
cheers, and turned to set up our tents for the first
time. We adhered closely to military style, and
our straight line of tents did not vary; dry sand or
wet mud had no effect on our position. In the
cool of the evening after I had done all I could for
the comfort of those around me, I stretched myself
out, with hat, coat and boots off, to look at the
busy scene around me. Gaily and cheerfully
everything went on, under a clear sky like that of
August at home, with all the soft, balmy, summer-like
feeling. About me were the familiar notes of
dozens of mocking-birds and thrushes. I opened
out the nucleus of my collections, a little package
of birdskins; a new thrush, a beautiful green jay, a
new cardinal, were side by side with two new
wood-peckers and a little dove, all new to our
fauna, and I carefully spread them out to dry, and
admired them. The sun went down, our supper
was ready, and never did a company enjoy their
meals more than we did for the first two days we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
were ashore, when exercise and good health gave
a relish to everything. Our guard was set and
detailed for the night, and I turned in on my
blankets with a short prayer for health and continuance
of blessings on my family.

CHAPTER II
<br />

<span class="s08">
DISASTER IN THE VALLEY OF THE RIO GRANDE</span>
</h2>

<p class="post">
<i>March 13th, 1849.</i> Daylight came in beautiful
and calm, but we were enveloped in a dense
fog, so heavy that though the clear sky could be
seen over head, not more than fifty yards could
be distinguished about us, and the tents looked as
if we had had a heavy rain in the night.
</p>

<p>
Col. Webb went over to Camargo to report
himself and the company to the Alcalde and
returned at night with a Mr. Nimons, and it was
arranged that they should go next day to China<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>
to purchase mules. Rob Benson was sergeant of
the guard that night, and I took a few turns around
our camp with him and turned in, but about eleven
was called to see J. Booth Lambert, who was very
sick. Dr. Trask began to fear his illness might
be cholera, but it was not in every respect like what
he had seen of that disease in the north. At three
o'clock, however, he seemed much easier and more
composed, alas, the composure of cholera. What
does it foretell? But in this instance to me "ignorance
was bliss." At five I was up again, mustard
plasters, rubbing and a tablespoonful of brandy
every half hour, with camphor, etc., were faithfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
administered, but all we knew and did was without
avail, and at one o'clock he was gone. Poor
fellow, he was kind to his companions, cheerful at
his work, and twenty-four hours previously, was,
to all appearance, perfectly well, and playing a
game of whist with his brother and uncle.
</p>

<p>
For the last six or eight hours of his illness all
the camp seemed to keep aloof from him, and all
the tents on that side of the camp were deserted
except Simson's and Harrison's, and those I
ordered off. When Hinckley, Liscomb and
Walsh came back from Rio Grande City with his
coffin, I had prepared him for burial, for his
brother was too prostrated with grief to do anything.
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock fifty of us followed him to the
grave. As we thought he would have wished, and
knew his friends would prefer, we buried him on
the American side, in the grave-yard back of
Davis' Rancho. Sadly we walked back with a
feeling that this might not be the only case of the
dread disease.
</p>

<p>
No time, however, was left for thought; as soon
as I entered the camp Lambert's messmates came
to beg me not to put them again in his tent. I
told them I had no idea of doing so, gave them a
new tent, struck his, levelled the ditches around it,
and burned the withered boughs that had been put
to shelter it. This done I went to rest if I could,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
being on this night of March 15th more anxious
than I had been for years. I had just dropped into
a troubled sleep, when I was called to look at
Boden, one of the most athletic, regular men we
had, who complained of great weakness and
nausea. We had, of course, talked over Lambert's
case, and as men will always try to assign causes
for everything, whether they understand matters
or not, we had said Lambert was always delicate
and had overworked himself, but, here was Boden,
a most robust, well-formed man, who had not
exposed himself in any way to illness, and so we
tried not to fear for him, but morning, March
16th, found him too weak to stand, and he showed
signs of all the horrors of this dreadful disease.
His broad forehead was marked with the blue and
purple streaks of coagulated blood, and down both
sides of the nose and blackening his whole neck
the veins and arteries told that it was all over with
him. "What hurts you, Ham?" I asked, as I saw
distress in his face. "My wife and children hurt
me, Mr. John," was his answer, which sent a thrill
to my heart; I, too, had wife and children. I said
what I could to console him, poor enough, doubtless,
but from my heart, God knows, and with tears
in my eyes, turned away to go to attend to Liscomb
and Whittlesey, both just taken.
</p>

<p>
I gave proper directions and at Dr. Trask's
suggestion went to Col. Webb's tent to tell him we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
must strike tents and leave the place at once. I
met with a decided refusal at first, but on my
repeating my request and stating the facts for a
second time, he consented. The company was
called and told that as previously arranged Col.
Webb was going on to China to purchase mules,
and that I was in charge of the camp, and would
at once make arrangements to remove all the men
who were well.
</p>

<p>
Providence here sent the steamer "Tom
McKenny" passing on her way to Roma. I went
on board and made the agreement that for one
hundred dollars all who could go should be taken
to Roma, and we at once set to work to pack and
hurry everything on board, retaining only what I
thought necessary for the three, now dying, men I
had with me. I called for volunteers who
responded instantly, and more than were needed,
to remain with me; those who were finally decided
upon for the sad duties before us, were Robert
Simson, Howard Bakewell, W. H. Harrison,
Robert Benson, Leffert Benson, John Stevens,
James Clement, Nicholas Walsh, Tallman and
Follen, with the two Bradys who were friends of
Boden, A. T. Shipman, W. H. Liscomb and Justin
Ely.
</p>

<p>
As Dr. Trask could be of no further use, we
insisted on his going on board the boat, as Follen
was with us and knows a great deal about medicine,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
though leaving home just before taking his degree
as a physician, deprives him of a title. All
arrangements being made, I only waited for the
boat to come up, and in a few minutes I had the
gratification of hearing her last bell, and seeing
her push off from our miserable camp for Rio
Grande City.
</p>

<p>
When the order was given to go on board and
take all the luggage, many started with only their
saddlebags, either in terror, or in apathy, from the
effect of the air on their systems. Scarcely more
than twenty men were willing to take provisions
enough to feed on for even one day. David
Hudson showed himself one of the most energetic
and helpful and there were some twenty others,
but I was too anxious and too hurried in directing
and working as well, to notice any but the most
faithful, and the most unfaithful.
</p>

<p>
I took Langdon Havens on board, never expecting
to see him again, he looked pale, yellow, blue,
black, all colors at once, the large blood vessels of
the neck swollen and black, showing how rapidly
the disease was gaining on him, and begged Trask
to do all he could for him. Then I came ashore
and saw the boat off, turned away and stood for a
moment to draw a long breath and wipe my
streaming face, the mercury was 99 degrees in the
shade. I looked at the group of good men who
had reluctantly left me and had assembled in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
stern of the boat to bid me good-bye; in silence
they took off their hats, not a sound was heard but
the escapement of the steam. Sorrow filled my
heart for the probable fate of so fine a body of men,
but it was no time now for reflections, I had three
dying men on my hands, and the business of the
camp to attend to.
</p>

<p>
I went to the sick tents; poor young Liscomb
worn out and heart broken sat leaning against the
tent where his father lay dying, looking as pallid
and exhausted as the sick man, and almost asleep;
I roused him and sent him to my tent to get some
rest. Edward Whittlesey was next, looking as if he
had been ill for months; his dog, a Newfoundland,
was walking about him, licking his hands and feet
and giving evidence of the greatest affection; from
time to time smelling his mouth for his breath,
but it was gone.
</p>

<p>
I slowly walked to Boden's tent but there was no
change from the stupor into which he had fallen;
and I sat down to wait, for what? All exertions
had been made to save our brave men, and all had
failed. Like sailors with masts and rudder gone,
wallowing in the trough of a storm-tossed ocean,
we had to await our fate, one of us only at a time
going from tent to tent of our dying companions
to note the hour of their last breath.
</p>

<p>
I suddenly thought I would try one more
resource, and I sent John Stevens to Dr. Campbell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
at Camp Ringgold, requesting him to tell the
Doctor, if he did not know who I was, that we
were Americans, and demanded his assistance. It
came, but alas, his prescriptions and remedies were
just those we had been using, calomel as soon as
possible, mustard externally, great friction, opium
for the pain, and slight stimulants of camphor and
brandy. John Stevens had just returned, when
Howard Bakewell, [who] had been his quarter of
an hour watching the sick, came into my tent, where
I was lying on my blankets, exclaiming, "My God,
boys, I've got it, Oh, what a cramp in my stomach,
Oh, rub me, rub away."
</p>

<p>
Simson and Harrison took him in hand, and I
read and re-read Dr. Campbell's directions which
we followed implicitly, but all to no purpose; one
short half hour found Howard insensible to pain
or sorrow. He asked me to tell his mother he
had died in the Christian faith she had taught
him, and his friends that he had died at his duty,
like a man. So went one of our days opposite
Davis' rancho, on the never-to-be-forgotten Rio
Grande.
</p>

<p>
At four o'clock, p. m., two of our small company
were dead, and two were lying senseless, and I told
the noble fellows, who, forgetting self, still struggled
for the company's good, that we would stay
no longer in that valley of death, but to make every
preparation to leave, and so they did. I was able
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
to help them but little, for with what I had undergone
the last fifty hours, and the terrible death of
my young cousin, Howard Bakewell, I was utterly
exhausted. Simson, Clement and John Stevens
went with me across the river to the town, and the
rest packed what was most valuable, and hired men
to guard the camp that night.
</p>

<p>
I lay on a bed in a small house belonging to Mr.
Phelps, listening and awaiting the arrival of the
bodies of Bakewell and Liscomb, who were
brought over under the direction of Harrison and
Simson, and in a sort of a dream I heard their
footsteps, sprang from the bed, and Bakewell was
laid upon it. I waited for the rest of the party
with my saddlebags containing the company's
money; that was all of value that I thought of, and
sometimes I wonder I thought of anything, I was
so weary. But Clement brought them and Liscomb
too, and the latter was laid out in the same
room with poor Howard. We then all went to
Armstrong's hotel, Clement carrying my bags and
valuables, and arriving found two more of our
party down with cholera. Dr. Campbell came to
see us and did all in his power for the sick, and
indeed for all of us, and told us it would be unsafe
for us to keep our money bags, but to give them
to the bar-keeper telling him their value, and
promising to pay him well for his trouble in caring
for them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
</p>

<p>
To tell how that night was passed would be
more than I can do; Nicholas Walsh and A. T.
Shipman became worse; I sent at once for Dr.
Campbell and he passed the night with us. The
heavy trade-wind from the south-east sighed
through the open windows of the long twenty-bedded
room we were in, the deep moans of young
Liscomb, who, dreaming, saw nothing but the
horrors of his father's death, our own sad thoughts,
and the sickness of Walsh and Shipman, and our
anxiousness, and perhaps nervousness, chased sleep
away.
</p>

<p>
Morning came, and our friends had to be buried,
and when this sad duty was over, we asked for our
money, and to our amazement were told it was
gone, had been delivered to one of our men. This
was untrue, and we sent at once to the landlord and
demanded our money. He coldly answered, "I
never saw you, gentlemen, when money is left in
this house, it is generally given to my charge, and
then I am responsible for it." It was useless to
explain that we had been unable to see him before,
and, at Dr. Campbell's suggestion, we took charge
of the man to whom we had intrusted it, and sent
for the magistrate who took the evidence for and
against, and committed the man to trial. As there
was no jail, or place of security in which to confine
him, we chained him to a musquit stump, and stood
guard over him forty-eight hours, assistance from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
the garrison of Fort Ringgold having been refused
us by Major La Motte.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 18th.</i> Today Harrison died of cholera
after about twelve hours sickness, and I lost his
assistance, which had been most valuable, and for a
time that of Simson, who was well nigh crazy at
the death of his friend, and who was besides completely
under the influence of cholera, having been
in the air of the malady nearly a week. The next
day he was up again, his strong constitution,
and still stronger mind, aiding his recovery,
and again I had his services, given with his
whole heart.
</p>

<p>
Today we told White, the man we held prisoner,
that we were so enraged that we intended to hang
him that night, or have the money back. When
the sun was about an hour high, he said if we would
let him go, he would tell where he had hid the
money; we promised that if he recovered the
money he might get away. At dusk we went with
him to find it, but his accomplice had been ahead
of him; never shall I forget his tone of despair,
when on removing some brush and briars by a
large cactus he exclaimed, "My God, it's gone."
Accustomed to the summary way of judging and
executing delinquents in Texas, he thought our
next move would be to hang him. He swore by
his God, his Saviour, and all that men held sacred,
that that was where he had left the money, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
prayed to be let go. Not one of us doubted the
truth of what he said <i>now</i>, but we took him back,
and again secured him, and that night Simson and
Horde arrested Hughes, whom we thought to be
his accomplice, finding him in a gambling house
surrounded by his cronies. He, too, was secured
and ironed, and slept on the ground, waking up in
the morning demanding his "bitters," and as
impudent as ever.
</p>

<p>
This day, March 19th, Mr. Upshur, a gentleman
acting as attorney and agent for Clay Davis at Rio
Grande City, and who had shown the greatest
sympathy and kindness to us in our troubles, and
exerted himself to the utmost to help us, called me
to him, led the way to his room, closed and locked
the door. He then asked me if I could swear to
my money if I saw it. I told him I could not, but
described it as well as I could remember. He
showed me three or four thousand dollars in gold
coin of different nations, and asked me again if I
could swear to it. I could not, though I fully
believed it was ours. He looked in my face so
closely, that for an instant I thought he doubted
who and what I was; but I met his clear eye, with
one as honest, and slowly he drew a piece of brown
post-office paper from his pocket, and asked: "Is
that your handwriting?" "No," was my answer,
"but it is that of Mr. Hewes of New Orleans, it is
his calculation of five hundred dollars in sovereigns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
and half eagles which Layton and Hewes
placed in my charge, and now I can swear to my
money if that paper was with what you have
showed me." He told me he had always been
satisfied it was mine, as he knew there was not such
an amount as I had lost, in the settlement. He
counted it twice, took my receipt, and as we went
to Camp Ringgold to leave it with the Quartermaster,
Lieut. Caldwell, who was always most
kind, Mr. Upshur told me the manner in which
this portion of our money had been regained.
</p>

<p>
Don Francisco, a Mexican, and father-in-law of
Clay Davis, was sheriff for the time, as the cholera
had taken off the regular officer of "Star County."
Whether Don Francisco was taking a midnight
walk to see the fate of the "Californians," or
watching what others might be doing to them, we
could never find out, but either he had followed
White and Hughes until they separated, after
which he could only watch one, which he did until
the thief had buried his share, which the Don
promptly removed; or else, with the wonderful
power of trailing which Indians and Mexicans
possess, on the fact of our loss being made known
to him, he may have found and followed the tracks
of the thieves, and on discovering the money thinking
this was all, have given up any further search,
until the trails were obliterated by the footsteps of
others. I may add here, that Don Francisco
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
generously refused any compensation for what he
had recovered, saying we had suffered enough.
</p>

<p>
The "Tom McKinney" which had taken our
party to Roma brought back eighteen or twenty of
the men on the way back to New Orleans. At
first I thought they had returned to be of some
assistance, but judge of my disappointment when
I learned the truth. The Bensons, Bradys, Barclay,
Tallman, Follen, Cowden, Ely and others were
determined to go home. The Bensons came to me
and said they were sorry to leave me, but they
found they were not fit for such a journey as they
had undertaken; many of the others went with a
simple "Good-bye," and some did not even come
up the hill to see me, and among these were some
of whom I did not expect it, Walker, especially,
for I thought a good deal of him, and had entrusted
him with the care of the sick on their way to Roma;
he never sent me any reason for not bidding me
good-bye, but I attributed it to the sudden news of
Harrison's death.
</p>

<p>
Desolate, indeed, did I feel as I watched the
boat start on her return trip taking some of my very
best men, or those I had thought were such, and I
realized how little one can judge from appearances
or when all is going smoothly. I was now left
with only Simson, Clement, John Stevens, Nic
Walsh, Mitchell and Elmslie, with Shipman very
ill. We were, however, encouraged by good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
reports of those at Roma, Langdon Havens was
recovering, and out of fifty-two more or less ill,
only two had died, though twenty were yet too
weak to move.
</p>

<p>
Horde, Upshur and Simson were taking most
vigorous measures to recover our stolen money, and
we again had Hughes on trial. He swore falsely
again and again, that he knew nothing of it. We
stood guard on him until we were compelled to
rejoin our party, having recovered only about three
thousand five hundred dollars, and lost all my
papers, receipts, accounts up to date, besides
letters of credit and introduction. I walked down
to Camp Ringgold to see if possibly I might have a
letter from home by a steamer just arrived, and on
the road met Lieut. Browning on his way to join
our company. I introduced myself to him and
appointed an hour to meet him at the hotel at
Davis's rancho, and went on to Major La Motte's
tent for letters. He was engaged when I arrived,
and too weary to sit down, I stretched myself on the
rushes he had for the floor of his tent and commenced
a conversation with Captain McCown, on
the subject of our troubles. He did not know me,
and began by: "The Audubons are well known
in their profession, but——." I interrupted him
by telling him he was too hard on me at first sight,
and he was a little confused, but his frank apology
soon put us on a friendly footing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On my return to Davis's rancho, I saw poor Dr.
Kearney who had undertaken the medical charge
of the party; and I heard of the lives he had saved,
and hoped still to have his aid for our suffering
company. But the fatigue he had undergone was
too much for him, and the day following this he
was no more. He was buried at Camp Ringgold,
where he had been cared for by Dr. Campbell,
and nursed by his cousin, John K. Rodgers, one of
my friends, who was so debilitated that he was
obliged to return north.
</p>

<p>
Having done all we could to recover our money
we left for Mier, via Roma, at the hottest hour of
the day, three o'clock, hoping to arrive before dark,
but after two hours stopped for shade and rest, for
the heat, owing to our debility, was insupportable;
at dusk we went on and reached Roma about eleven
at night.
</p>

<p>
Roma, named after General Roman of Texan
celebrity, is situated on a sandstone bluff, perhaps
a hundred feet high, but like all the rest of the
country on this line, with no trees, only an interminable
chaparral of musquit, cactus (of three
species), an occasional aloe, maguay<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> and wild
sage, at this season covered with its bluish-purple
flower, almost as delicate as the light green of the
leaf. With the exception of the large, coarse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
cactus, which ought to be called "giganteus,"
almost all the plants are small leaved; worst of
all, every tree, shrub and plant is thorny to a degree
no one can imagine until they have tried a thicket
of "tear-blanket" or "cat's claw." The distant
view was exquisitely soft, hill and valley stretching
for miles about us, looking like a most beautifully
cultivated country, the bare spots only like small
fields, and the rest deluding the weary traveller in
the belief that the distance is a change from the
arid, bleak country through which he is riding.
</p>

<p>
We turned in at a small store, found a loaf of
bread and some whiskey, and lay down on the
floor with our saddles for pillows, and blankets
for beds, and slept soundly. At daylight I made
up our party, saw them over the river in a small
flatboat and rode on, thinking of our situation and
wondering again and again how I could have been
so thoughtless as to entrust our money to anyone,
even with Dr. Campbell's advice, and what course
to take now. I could, of course, do nothing but
await my interview with Col. Webb, who had
written to bring the prisoners along and <i>he</i> would
get the money. The difficulty was that by the
laws of Texas a man can not be taken out of his
own county to be tried, and it is also against the
law to lynch him. Then, too, five men could not
easily remove a desperado with some twenty accomplices,
through twenty-five miles of wilderness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I was so weak I was but just able to continue to
ride, and so depressed in spirits that I was almost
in despair. We reached our camp on the Alamo
River, a little creek three miles from Mier, and I
was surprised to see a carriage as we rode up. In
a minute I saw Col. Webb sitting in it with one
foot on the back seat and Dr. Trask bathing it. He
had had a touch of diarrhœa and had hired a
carriage to ride down from S—— where he had
received my letter advising him of our loss, and
jumping out of the conveyance hastily, had
sprained his ancle and was in great pain. I found
all in disorder, and the men came flocking round
me, and, as I told them our experiences since I had
written, they, in return told me of their own
adventures.
</p>

<p>
Tonight, March 21st, Col. Webb was taken very
ill with bilious cholera, and we thought he would
have died; we worked over him until morning
when he was better.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 22.</i> Cholera broke out again this morning,
and I was a sufferer, but not to die of it, and
was lying twelve hours after my attack resting,
when I was called to see young Combs who had
just been taken ill. The night before Mr. Upshur
had sent for me, and a small force, to aid in a guard
he wanted over a man he thought had a portion of
our money, and, as was my custom, I called for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
volunteers (a lesson I learned from Jack Hayes<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a>
when I was in Texas), and Combs was one of the
first to come forward. He was so debilitated I
refused to let him go, and it was quite a task, tired
and ill as I was, to convince him, it was his strength,
not his spirit I doubted. How glad he was now,
that I had not allowed him to go. Alas, he had a
longer journey before him. At ten next morning
the fatal stupor came over him. His friend J. J.
Bloomfield had been like a brother to him, untiring
in his devotion, and when in a few hours Combs
ceased to breathe Bloomfield almost collapsed himself.
Of the entire company that started with us
for California, at one time numbering ninety-eight,
Hudson, Bloomfield, Bachman and Damon were
all who were able to help me perform the last rites
for their companion.
</p>

<p>
After two hours hard work we had dug a grave,
and returned to camp, the soil was a lime-like one,
so hard that every inch had to be picked. Our
whole camp was silent, as we wrapped Combs in
his blankets; "not a drum was heard nor a funeral
note," came strongly to my mind, and about twenty
of the company started to follow to the grave; the
burning heat of the day was past and the sun
was just setting in a sky without a cloud. All
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
moisture seemed to have left the face of nature,
the distant prairies, broken only here and there by
a musquit, gave a wild desolation to the scene,
and as we fell into line without an order being
given, I thought I had never seen a more forlorn,
haggard set of men. Sadly indeed, did we bear
our late companion to his last home, and when we
reached the grave only eleven men had had
strength to follow. We lowered the body with
our lariats and I read the funeral service. As I
said, "Let us pray," all kneeled, and when I added
a short but heartfelt prayer for courage, energy
and a return of health to our ill-fated company,
not a dry eye was amongst us; not one man but
felt our position one of solemnity seldom, if ever,
experienced before by any of us. We returned to
our desolate camp to look on others still in danger
and needing consolation, even if we could not give
relief. So ended our last day on the banks of the
Alamo, and we retired to our tents to think on who
might be the next to go, all ideas of business being
for the time driven from our minds; even those
not ill, seemed almost apathetic.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 23d.</i> Again came morning with its
fiery sun burning and drying everything. Breakfast
was tasted, but not eaten. A committee from
the company came to know what should be done.
Col. Webb with one of our doctors and four men
went off to Mier, to get out of the sun, for with all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
his boast of, "I live as my men live," he said he
"should die in that sun." I was obliged to go
back to Rio Grande City about our money, so I told
the men that we had better wait and see what
further money we could recover and how our
health was likely to be. All acquiesced, and with
Clement and Simson I left for Roma on my way
to Rio Grande, where I recovered four thousand
dollars more of our money; I still hoped to regain
the balance, about seven thousand dollars, but it
was never found.
</p>

<p>
To tell of the dull monotony of this place would
be most tedious, nearly as hard to think of as to
endure. I found the officers of the camp my most
sympathetic companions, Captain McCown, Dr.
Campbell, Lieuts. Caldwell, Hazzard and Hayne,
and Captain Deas.
</p>

<p>
Four days of fruitless examinations passed, and
one night I had made my blankets into a bed, and
was trying to find a soft position for my weak and
bony legs, when Clement came to tell me I was
wanted in Judge Stakes's room; with Lieut.
Browning I went over. At a circular table
covered with books and papers, lighted by a single
candle, sat Clay Davis, his fine half-Roman, half-Grecian
head resting on his small, well shaped
hand, his position that which gave us the full
beauty first of his profile, then of full face; his
long black hair with a soft wave in it gave wildness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
and his black moustache added to a slight sneer as
he looked at a Mexican thief standing before him;
he was altogether one of the most striking figures I
have ever seen. Opposite was Judge Stakes, also
a very handsome man, as fair in hair and complexion
as Clay Davis was dark. Behind him
stood Simson with his Vandyke head and peaked
beard; he was in deep shadow, with arms folded,
and head a little bowed, but his searching eyes
fixed keenly on the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
One step in advance stood Don Francisco putting
question after question to the thief, a little further
off stood three other rascals, their muscular arms
tied, waiting "adjudication."
</p>

<p>
On the other side, in the light, sat another Mexican
holding the stolen property which had been
recovered; and behind him a table with glasses,
bottles and a demijohn. Lieut. Browning and I
sat on a cot bed covered with a Mexican blanket,
watching the whole scene, denials, confessions,
accusations, threats, and one after another piece by
piece was produced of our property. All the
clothes were recovered, amid questions and oaths in
Spanish and English, until we abandoned all hope
of regaining anything more.
</p>

<p>
With Lieut. Browning I left to return to Mier,
but half-way between Davis's rancho and Roma
met the company in wagons which they had hired.
All were well, but so weary and debilitated they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
had decided to go home. I continued on my way
to see Col. Webb and get his ideas on the course
to be pursued. I received his orders and left at
two o'clock that night with his son, Mitchell, and
Lieut. Browning; regained the company, called
the men together, read their agreement to them,
and said all I could to remind them of the obligations
they were under to go on and fulfil their
contract, but almost universal refusal met my
appeal. Only twenty-one agreed to go on; what
a falling off from ninety-eight! Out of those who
agreed to go on two were cooks, two teamsters,
two servants, and some few who said they did not
care for the company, they only wanted to go to
California. Can it be wondered at that I doubted
such men? I left them all to reconsider their
position, and went off to think over my own
troubles, and make up my mind how to act. In
half an hour I returned and told the men my
determination. "I have thought of my position
in the company, I have done all I could in the
interests of the company, but now I am going home.
I am not old enough to preach to you, but should
you go home, let contentment and gratitude for
what you have be gained by the hardships and
sorrows you have endured, and may God bless
those who go on, and those who return." So ended
"Col. Webb's California Co."
</p>

<p>
Fortune, always fickle, now changed. No
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
steamer came to take us back; for two days we
were quite determined to take the voyage homewards,
but with returning health the men began
to feel encouraged, and I thought perhaps I ought
to make another effort to go on. I consulted all I
could on the subject, and of course had varying
opinions. Captain McCown said: "Go back, no
one can do anything with volunteers, you have no
power to compel obedience; now you go back
honorably, and you don't know what you will have
to endure on a march through Mexico." Lieut.
Caldwell urged me to go on, said "it was military
education never to give up, so long as there was
any possibility of the original idea being carried
out."
</p>

<p>
Slowly I walked along thinking. I had not found
the men disobedient, and I believed the cholera
was the chief cause of discouragement, and the fact
that Col. Webb had left the men in their distress
the source of the anger against him. I decided
that I could go on, and determined to make one
more effort. That evening while sitting under an
ebony tree, about eight o'clock, in the darkness
which follows so rapidly on the short southern
twilight, I heard a song from one of our company,
and in a few minutes a chorus, good spirits seem to
have returned, and leaving my seat I went over to
Armstrong's Hotel.
</p>

<p>
On the counter of the bar-room lay Lieut.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
Browning; two or three persons were seated at his
feet, and on stools around the room lounged, or sat,
our little band, our saddles, blankets, etc., filling a
corner of the room. General Porter was there
listening to the close of a chorus. One of the party
pushed a saddle over for me to sit on, and I began
my little address: "How strange it is that the
thought of home should, in one short day, so change
your spirits; who would have thought that fifty
such men would be turned back by the first difficulties?
What will you say to your friends?
Forget your homes for a time and go on like men."
But the old answer came, "We won't go on under
the present management," and "We won't go on
with Col. Webb." I told them it was not possible
for them to go on with Col. Webb, as an hour before
I had received a communication from him saying
his health would not permit him to go on with us,
and appointing a time to have a business interview
with him before he left on his return home. A
silence followed this announcement, and then
Lieut. Browning said "Let's go on with Mr. Audubon."
Three cheers gave their answer, but I told
the men not to decide then in a moment of excitement,
to wait until morning and make up their
minds in cool blood, as I wanted no more change,
and this would be their last resolve. At ten next
morning we met, and all but six agreed to go on,
and we at once moved to a camping ground five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
miles back from the Rio Grande, out of the way
of cholera, to feed up our weak, and make our
arrangements to leave. I at once ordered from
Alexander sixty mules, thirty to be first-class saddle
mules, and thirty good, average pack mules.
</p>

<p>
It took nearly a month to make all our preparations,
wind up our business with Col. Webb and
others, and to put our sick men in good travelling
condition. When we had removed our provisions
from Camp Ringgold, where we had stored them,
our heaviest work was done, and we started for
Mier, but found we had not mules enough and
stopped at —— to get more, and here we also
repaired the miserable wagons that had been
bought at Cincinnati, arranging our guard and
other matters. Henry Mallory and I counted our
money, and allowed a hundred days as the time
requisite for our journey, and our financial calculations
gave sixty-six dollars and four cents for
each man.
</p>

<p>
How the responsibility of taking forty-eight
men, most of them wholly ignorant of the life
before us, through so strange and wild a country,
weighed upon me, I cannot express, but we were
too busy to have much time to think, and moved
on twenty miles to Mier. Luckily our wagons
broke down again, so we concluded to leave them,
and lost another week disposing of them, and selling
goods we were unable to take. At Mier I saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
Col. Webb off, with his proportion of money and
provisions.
</p>

<p>
Mier is like every other Mexican town I have
seen, it is composed of one square only, and all the
rest suburbs, the houses built of adobe. To the
southwest, hills, parched and arid, give an unpleasing
foreground of the superb view of the mountains
of Cerralvo, all the blue of Italy was again before
me, with the exception of the blues of the Mediterranean
Sea.
</p>

<p>
Two more of our company returned to us here,
one of whom, Ulysses Doubleday, was so weak and
reduced that I left him in charge of his friends
Bachman and Elmslie, and gave him what money
he needed to carry him home. I certainly thought
him a dying man, but it was otherwise ordained,
and he reached his friends safely and well. Bachman
and Elmslie were true to me throughout all.

CHAPTER III
<br />

<span class="s08">
MEXICO FROM THE RIO GRANDE TO THE MOUNTAINS</span>
</h2>

<p class="post">
<i>April 28th, 1849.</i> The company started today,
and I expect to follow early tomorrow, and join
the men who are now fifteen miles ahead of me.
I am compelled to remain to attend to the property
of the ten men who have died of cholera in this
accursed place; it goes to New Orleans by boat in
the morning. Why Col. Webb, who had been in
this country before, selected this route instead of
a more northerly one, I cannot understand, but it
is now too late to change, and we must go forward
with courage.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 29th. Canales Run.</i> We are all on our
way, having come to Ceralvo, [Cerralvo]<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> beautiful
for its old mission, and curious in its irrigating
canals, bridges and old church, still it has the
apathetic lassitude of everything Mexican. We
rode on to Robber's Rancho, over undulating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
wastes of hard, unprofitable soil. The palmettos
are here by the thousand, and their fantastic shapes
gave the appearance of horsemen of gigantic size,
riding through grass almost as tall.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 1st.</i> Robber's Rancho, once a fine
hacienda, was burned by the Americans, in the
last war, for the rascality of its owners; it is on
a beautiful plain, but brush has grown up in the
now neglected fields, and all is in ruins. Here
we came near losing Lieut. Browning from
cholera, but he was saved by Dr. Trask's indefatigable
exertions.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 12th. Near Monterey.</i> We have been
here four days having horses and mules shod, and
I will take my pencil notes and write up my journal
to date.
</p>

<p>
We were at Robber's Rancho a week, waiting
for Bachman, Elmslie and Carrol, who had been
left with Doubleday. As soon as they rejoined
us we moved on to Papogias [Popagallos] then
to Ramos where we met some French traders with
a long train of mules and their "cargoes."
</p>

<p>
Ramos was followed by Marin and Aquafrio;
all present a dilapidated appearance, very different
from what was seen when the country was
under the fine system of irrigation, and the remains
of past opulence everywhere sadden the traveller.
</p>

<p>
We reached Walnut Springs, five miles from
Monterey, on the 8th of May, and are taking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
needed rest in the shade of the Spanish walnuts,
and enjoying the delightful water, which bursts
out in a fountain of six to eight feet wide, and
about a foot deep, clear but not cool, yet pleasant
to drink. Monterey is at the base of a range of
mountains, which surround it on all sides except
to the north. Its entrance over bridges, many
of them very picturesque, shows abundance of
water, which irrigates the beautiful valley for
miles beyond Molino.
</p>

<p>
Where did I hope to be at this date? Yet here
we are scarcely started; one month lost in sickness
and sorrow, and one in the re-organization of our
company. We are full two months behind our
reckoning, and on a route of which I never
approved, but which, when I took command, we
were already compelled to pursue. We are having
the horses and mules shod, for their feet are
so tender we can not continue without. We travel,
usually twenty or twenty-five miles a day, as the
chance for water and forage for our horses occurs.
The uncertainty of provisions is such that we have
to carry corn for one or two feeds ahead, which
adds considerably to the weight of our packs, and
gives us a good deal of trouble.
</p>

<p>
As I sit here, I hear the notes of many new
birds, as well as those well known, and the sky
overhead is bluer than any Italy ever presented to
me. Monterey, where I have been several times,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
is an improvement on the other Mexican towns
we visited, but full of foreigners of all nations
come to prey on the ignorance of the poor inhabitants.
All now seems well regulated, but I dread
shortness of provisions and we have to be very
careful. I have not heard from home since the
date of February 19th and now must wait, I fear,
until we reach, if we ever do reach, the Pacific
coast.
</p>

<p>
The company are all tired, the work is new and
it takes time to become accustomed to the broken
night's rest. At midnight I take the rounds of
our camp in moonlight, starlight or darkness, to
see that all is well, and that none relax in vigilance,
so requisite to safety in this country of thieves.
This gives me only six hours of sleep, for after we
have had supper, it is eight o'clock, and we get
up at four a. m., so that taking out the two hours
nightly, reduces me to that amount, but "habit
is second nature." If you hear of any more men
coming to California overland, tell them three
shirts, six pairs of socks, one coat, one great coat,
two pairs of trousers and two pairs of boots, should
be all the personal luggage. No man should bring
more than he can carry.
</p>

<p>
I have had quite a scene with the Alcalde here.
Our camp was infested with pigs, which came
from every direction every morning and evening
when we fed our horses and mules. Of course,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
we could not see them robbed, stones and hatchets
were abundant, and some pistols went off, which
the boys declared did so accidentally. We could
not find the owners, so I went to [the] Alcalde to
pay for them, taking an Italian boy as interpreter.
The boy instead of saying what I told him, which
was simply to ask the value and pay it, added on
his own account, that if his Honor was not satisfied
with what we gave, we would come in and take
the town. Naturally the Alcalde resented this,
and I found my little vagabond had been telling
his own story, not mine. Upon matters being
explained by a more trustworthy source, the
Alcalde was perfectly content, and bowed me out
with much courtesy.
</p>

<p>
The adroitness of the Mexicans in thieving
equals that of the rascals at Naples. In two
instances pistols have been taken from the holsters
whilst the owners held the bridles of their horses.
All this has tended to excite revenge, and without
good discipline outbreaks of temper might have
occurred, which would undoubtedly have brought
us into trouble, as happened with several other
companies on the road to Mazatlan.
</p>

<p>
<i>Saltillo, May 20th.</i> Here we are, thank God,
fairly on our way, and at present in good health
and spirits. We travel about twenty-five miles a
day, but have great difficulty in keeping our
horses and mules in good order, as there is no grass
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
for grazing purposes, and corn varying in quality,
but always high in price, from one dollar to fifty
cents per bushel.
</p>

<p>
When we left Monterey we followed the road to
Rinconada, which is a beautifully located rancho,
well watered and with a long avenue of pollard
poplars or cotton-woods; the boles not more than
ten or fifteen feet high, so that the flawy gusts that
are like little hurricanes for a few seconds, and
which come from the mountains which surround the
place in every direction, cannot blow them down.
Here we saw the first magua plants, from the juice
of which pulke [pulque] is made, and afterwards
muscale [mescal] distilled. Muscale in taste is
more like creosote and water, slightly sweetened,
than anything I can compare it to, and I suppose
it is about as wholesome.
</p>

<p>
The peons who do the work of the hacienda are
completely Indian in character, appearance and
habits, sometimes marvelous in their strength and
activity, and sometimes surprising us with their
unsurpassed laziness. The women, patient things,
like all squaws, carry wood, water, and do all the
household labor.
</p>

<p>
From this beautiful little amphitheatre among
the hills we wound along parched arroyos and
valleys, and I could not but be struck with the wise
provision of nature for the protection of its creations.
Almost all the trees have tap roots, or if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
fibrous, they run so deep in search of moisture,
that they are often longer than the tree is high.
In the arroyos where the earth was often washed
from the roots, I had a good opportunity of confirming
my conclusions. We proceeded up a deep
ravine, until we began the ascent of the famed
pass of Rinconada, intended to be defended by
Santa Anna, but abandoned when our troops
approached. How any force of artillery could
have deserted such a position I can not conceive,
for the unfinished fort commands the road for two
miles at least.
</p>

<p>
The view from the Fort was most superb, but we
were tired of mountains, and longed for shade and
woods. Crossing this pass we had our first indication
of increasing altitude, and above us on the
rocks were pines and cedars. They had the
showers we longed for and saw passing, while
almost smothered in dust, our hair and whiskers
white with it, and we looked like a troop of grey
veterans.
</p>

<p>
We approached Saltillo over a broad plain,
dotted with ranchos for some miles before we
reached the town, which we entered through lanes
of adobe walls, and finally came to the principal
street, and commenced the ascent of the hill on
which the town proper stands. It is all Mexican
in its character, one story houses, flat roofed and
having a fortified look, as if no one trusted his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
neighbor. The public square is a fine one, and
the cathedral front the most beautiful I have seen
on this side of the Atlantic. The workmen who
did the carving came from Spain, and the stone
from the Rocky Mountains, so goes the story.
Saltillo has many good points, it is clean, well
regulated, and [has] better buildings than any I
have seen except at Monterey, yet we pushed on,
and have made our camp at Buena Vista, six miles
further on. High mountains bound our view on
every side. Buena Vista had its battle, and few
of us but have some friend or acquaintance sleeping
there.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parras, May 28th.</i> I shall never forget the
Buena Vista Camp, the night of the 23d and 24th,
it was the night previous to our departure for this
place; the guard was slow in coming out, Montrose
Graham was guard over my tent that watch, and
as Simson called his guard to order, and faced me,
where I had risen up to see who were changing,
George Weed let his rifle fall. The cock was
down on the nipple, contrary to a positive order;
in falling, the head of the hammer struck the
ground first, and, as if the trigger had been pulled,
it went off. An exclamation came from either
side, one "Mr. Audubon's killed," the other from
me: "Who's hurt?" A groan from poor Graham
was the answer. We were all hurry for lights
and water, and the Doctor. All loved Graham,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
he was the handsome man of the original party of
ninety-eight, just twenty-two, and the Captain of
his tent, "The Hailstorm Mess," so called by Lieut.
Browning, from its go-ahead principles.
</p>

<p>
The ball had passed through his ancle, and
both Drs. Perry and Trask said he could not go
on for some weeks. So it was decided to leave his
cousin, Molinear, with him, a more practical
physician than most of his age, and as much money
as we could spare, that they could follow us or
return home, as seemed most judicious.
</p>

<p>
Frank Carrol, as good a man as I ever wish
on such an expedition, found accommodations for
Graham, and remained with him at Saltillo. How
we parted from them only those can know who
have been compelled to leave friends in a strange
land.
</p>

<p>
For several days our road continued over long
hills, and parched valleys, and on the last day of
this travel we had a most extraordinary view. We
had climbed a hill, not more than three hundred
feet high, but very steep, and reached a broad plain
five or six miles wide, but much longer. On every
side was a chain of sterile volcanic mountains; it
was, for one view, most wonderful; it looked as if
an immense lake, that threatened to cover the
mountains, had suddenly been changed to earth.
Crossing this plain and rounding one of the
desolate peaks, we came to the hacienda of Don
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
Emanuel Hivarez, who has five hundred peons at
work. The water used for irrigation, without
which nothing could be grown, is brought in an
adobe aqueduct for several miles. It is an old
settlement and very dirty, abounding in fleas and
vermin of all descriptions. Yet when one comes
to a hacienda with water all round, brought from
some mountain stream, the contrast between the
desolate land we have travelled and the exuberant
luxuriance of vines, figs and magua gives a beauty
which almost makes me, with my hatred of everything
Mexican, admire our surroundings. Mocking-birds
are all around us, and could I linger to
explore, I have no doubt I could have added many
new birds to my list, but with cholera hanging
round, breaking out, in a mild form it is true, at
every place we stop at, we must push on.
</p>

<p>
We daily pass cacti of three species, as well as
miles of aloes, yet not enough nourishment to feed
a horse in the whole of them, and through this
country we start tomorrow for Chihuahua. We
have one hundred and fifty-seven mules and horses
and fifty-seven men, and are in good spirits. We
hear Chihuahua is our best route, but we may
have different information at Parral and go
through Sonora.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 29th.</i> Parras is like all Mexican towns
I have seen, a few French and Americans, some
with a Mexican wife, others with a housekeeper;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
but all indolent, keeping little stores and warehouses
and making immense profits. It is celebrated
for wines and brandy, made principally by
foreigners.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 30th.</i> At three o'clock this morning I
was taken with sharp pains, nausea and other
symptoms of cholera, and for the first time was
obliged to ride in the ambulance, but towards
evening was able to be up again, though very much
debilitated.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 2d.</i> We left Parras at five this morning,
and at dusk reached El Paso [El Pozo], and
camped on a gravelly hill. For miles a barren
desert lined both sides of our road, until we came
to a swamp tract, with extraordinary luxuriance of
rank weeds, no grass, and passing this entered a
dismal thicket of chaparral.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 3d, Sunday.</i> We left El Paso at eight this
morning, and rode until ten, when we reached a
deserted rancho, and with some trouble encamped
near a river bed with waterholes along it. A
beautiful lagoon with water holes a hundred yards
long enabled us all to take refreshing baths, and
I watched with pleasure the languid flight of the
great blue heron, changing his position as he was
approached. Two Mexicans, hunting cattle, came
to us here, and Lieut. Browning bought a wild
mule, for which he gave a few dollars and a broken
down mule.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>June 2d.</i> [?] Again we have been through
swamp-like country, crossed the dry bed of a river,
with white sand glaring painfully in our faces, and
found acres of wild sunflowers, and patches of what
looked like horehound, then we came to a cottonwood
bottom, gradually changing to a golden
willow, which grew so luxuriantly on both sides of
the road that I was reminded of the rich bottom
lands of Ohio.
</p>

<p>
At noon we came to Alamito, a large rancho, or
small village of scoundrels. In bargaining for
water, which is only to be had from wells, we found
the men who had it for sale were making their
own terms with our rascally guide, and Simson
stepped up and began talking to them. They pretended
they could not understand, but on my tapping
my revolver they instantly became most
intelligent.
</p>

<p>
Here we had the first attempt at a "stampede"
made upon us. Those intending to run off the
"cabalgada"<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> of a travelling party, take a strong
horse, cover him with the skin of an ox which has
been newly killed, putting the fleshy side out, tie
all the bells they have to the horse, and fastening
an enormous bunch of dry brush to his tail, set fire
to it, and start him off with yells and shouts through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
the camp of those to be stampeded. Horses and
mules, keen of scent and hearing, receive warnings
of danger through both faculties, and are so
frightened they will break any ordinary fastening.
No matter which way they go, the vagabonds are
such beautiful riders they soon turn the herd to
any course they like, and make their escape, for
those robbed have nothing to follow on; for, even
if a few animals are left, the speed of the thieves
can never be equalled. In this instance our vigilant
guard saved us; what would have become of
us if they had not, I dare not think.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 7th, Mapimi.</i> After a ride of twenty
leagues we reached this place last night just before
twelve, and lay down without food for either ourselves
or our horses, and the poor animals had only
had water once that day. The journey had been
well enough. From time to time we enjoyed a
pleasant shade through a larger growth of musquits
than common, and again the country was bare
of all vegetation. Tired though we were, our
sleep was poor, for we were in a sort of barnyard
full of hogs, and surrounded by thieving Mexicans.
</p>

<p>
This is a mining town and has several smelting
furnaces where charcoal is used. Lead, and
about an ounce of silver to every hundred pounds
of ore, is produced, so the silver pays for the
smelting, and in some of the mines copper is found.
The furnaces externally are picturesque, not high,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
but with eccentric peaks, mitre-shaped, and harmonizing
well with the rugged mountains which
surround this dirty little town, where idleness and
dirt, dogs and fleas abound.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 9th.</i> We rested a day at Mapimi, and
reached La Cadena this evening, having come nine
leagues; we shall stay here tomorrow to have the
tires of our wagon set and to rest. This rancho has
a fortified appearance, and mounts one small
cannon, it looks able to resist a heavy attack from
the Indians.
</p>

<p>
The road to this place is almost level for twenty
miles, when, entering a gorge with abundant grass,
it winds up a gradual ascent for two or three miles,
and to the west we had a grand view, in the middle
of which stood the hacienda. A long front of
white wall, a tower at each end, with the usual
archway in the center, over which was mounted
a small brass piece, made the whole show of the
establishment; and though formidable to the
Apaches, who are about here in numbers, to us
was only picturesque. Today we lost two of our
best horses with cholera; the poor beasts suffering
so much in the manner that men do, that it was
painful to have our own troubles brought back so
forcibly to our minds.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 10th.</i> We left for Pantilla at eight last
night; it was eleven leagues distant; and being a
deserted rancho no food could be had there, so we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
intended watering at the place, taking a short rest,
then going seven leagues farther to La Zarca. Two
hours after we started the moon rose behind us, and
truly we presented a most picturesque appearance.
Some in coats, some in blankets Mexican fashion,
others in shooting jackets; we grew very tired and
longed for sleep, but it was not to be taken except
on horseback. Morning came and we stopped for
an hour to graze our horses and mules, and rode
past the deserted rancho without stopping to water,
and came on to La Zarca, having had our poor
animals under the saddle for twenty hours, during
which we made sixty-four miles, ourselves only
having to eat what we had expected for one meal.
As we came up the mountains that overlooked this
plain, we saw the first antelopes, and I was at one
time within two hundred yards of three, but I did
not shoot, and was never so near again. Many
black-tailed hare have been seen and shot, and their
variety of pelage would make twenty species.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 12th.</i> Today, Sunday, we are resting men
and animals, and tranquillity is all about us. These
long journeys are very injurious to our horses; one
such long trip leaves them much more jaded and
impoverished than two shorter ones, even though,
as now, we always take a day's rest.
</p>

<p>
La Zarca is beautiful to look at, the centre of
attraction being a fine clump of cotton-woods,
letting the white walls of the hacienda shine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
through them. We bought a beef, killed it, and
our meal was speedily cooked and eaten. Looking
day after day on the same desolate scene, rendered
so only by the want of rain, rarely camped in
shade, this journey becomes wearisome beyond
belief.
</p>

<p>
The broad plain on which this rancho is situated
once grazed six thousand head of horse, all owned
by one person, but when the Spanish government
was given up for no government, which is the case
now, Indians and Mexicans supplied themselves
with stolen horses in abundance.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 13th.</i> From La Zarca to Cerro Gordo the
country is flat and uninteresting, barren in most
places of all but musquit bushes. Every mile or
so for the first few leagues we crossed a beautiful
little brook, which was, however, gradually
absorbed by the thirsty sand, a water hole and bed
of sand appearing alternately, until the water
wholly disappeared. We made two days' journey
of it, going the first day eighteen miles, where we
found good grazing on partially dry grass, better
for horses and mules than corn alone, which half
the time has been all we could get for them. Our
most serious trouble now is the sore backs of our
mules produced by the pack saddles, which were
made in our own country, and are too broad for
the backs of the Mexican mules. Cerro Gordo is
a miserable den of vagabonds, with nothing to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
support it but its petty garrison of a hundred and
fifty cavalry mounted on mules. We were hooted
and shouted at as we passed through, and called
"Gringoes," etc., but that did not prevent us from
enjoying their delicious spring water; it was cool
and delightful. Our men rushed to it, and drank
two pint cups full each, hardly breathing between
times; it was the first good water we had had since
leaving the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
Here we were visited by a member of a Mexican
travelling circus, who asked our protection as far
as El Valle, which we promised them. The party
consisted of five, one woman and four men. The
lady rode as we used to say in Louisiana "leg of a
side," on a small pacing pony; the two horses of
the ring carried only their saddles, two pack mules,
four small trunks, and four jaded horses the rest
of the plunder. The four men went one on foot,
driving the packs and continually refitting and
repacking, the other three riding. One man had
two Chihuahua dogs about six inches long, stuffed
in his shirt bosom, another a size larger on the
pommel of his saddle. A second man was in
grand Spanish costume, on a small but blooded
grey horse, with a large dragoon sword on his left,
and a Mexican musket made about 1700, which
would have added to an antiquary's armory. They
told us they had everything they owned with them,
so that if alone, and attacked by the Apaches, whom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
we hear of continually but never see, their loss
would be a very serious one to them.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 14th.</i> We left Cerro Gordo at eight a. m.
and ascended steadily up hill for about two miles,
the country poor and uninteresting, and the miles
seem to stretch out interminably. We are now
camped at El Noria.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 15th.</i> Rio Florida. We are repaid for
our tiresome journey by the shade and refreshment
we find here; the old mission is the most commodious
we have seen, built of nearly white marble,
the four pillars next the church richly carved and
almost perfect. When the old priests had this
broad valley tilled and irrigated by the convert
Indians it must indeed have been a scene of luxurious
growth, and they, no doubt, lived in great
comfort, if isolation. Still the place is inland, and
indolence there as everywhere in Mexico reigns
supreme. So fell Rio Florida.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 17th.</i> From Rio Florida to El Valle, ten
leagues, our road in places has been most beautiful;
undulating plains like those of Texas, and we saw
the first streaks of iron mixed with the limestone
which for weeks we have been traveling through.
We shall be glad of any change, for our lips are
cracked, and so sore as to give pain and discomfort
all the time, while our hands are cracked and split
as in mid-winter.
</p>

<p>
Here at El Valle, sometimes called Bia Valle,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
we are encamped in a grove of cotton-wood, which,
I should say, had been planted forty or fifty years
ago, and the gardens when irrigated must have
been most luxuriant. We are now in an iron
district, and the walls of the Jacals have changed
from white to red. The hillsides, too, have
changed in color; some are reddish and bare,
others grey, from dead grass and lime underneath.
</p>

<p>
Bia or El Valle is situated on another of those
beautiful creeks that from time to time occur in this
part of Mexico; it contains a motley crowd, doubtful
of face and of character; largely half-breeds,
and speaking Spanish, so murdered into patois,
that Lieut. Browning, a fluent Spanish scholar,
was some time learning to understand their
language. Our circus party left us here; the
woman who was really the queen of the show came
to thank us for our protection, which she did most
gracefully, and gave us a courteous invitation to
her show and fandango, the termination to every
Mexican entertainment, wedding, christening, and
even battle. I could not go, but several of the
party did, and pronounced the senoritas quite good
looking.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 18th, Parral.</i><a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a> Half way between El Valle
and Parral, at a rancho on one of the bends of the
Rio Florida, is a most splendid specimen of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
meteoric iron, almost pure in quality. It is, at its
highest point, four feet above the ground, and
from two to five feet one way, by two to three the
other, very irregular. Where it is worn by the
passers by rubbing their hands it is bright, and
looks like a lump of pure ore.
</p>

<p>
A long, steep zigzag descent, rocky beyond
belief, and painful to our poor mules, many of
which had lost shoes, brought us into Parral, which
is wild and picturesque in situation as well as in
buildings, but yet desolate.
</p>

<p>
The balconies, so to speak, built in front of the
silver mines, high on the sides of the mountains
which entirely surround the town, give it a fortified
appearance, and convey the idea of a respectability
which we have not seen since we left Saltillo. We
skirted the town, and are encamped on the banks
of the river or creek that runs through the centre;
our tents were soon in place and guard set, for we
were immediately surrounded by at least a hundred
idlers. While talking to some Americans,
Lieut. Browning had his pistol stolen from his
holster, while standing within three feet of his
mule. This makes the fifth lost in this way. He
drew his revolver and ordered the crowd off, and
in an instant the ground was clear, and the fear that
characterizes these miserable creatures was shown
as they hurried off, holding their hats to shield the
back of their heads.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We are, comparatively speaking, camped in a
paradise, for we have pollarded cotton-woods to
give us shade, a dashing little brook, and an aviary
of birds to enliven or calm, to cheer and encourage
us, and are in real enjoyment of rest from fatigue
and pain, all but my thigh, which is very painful
from the presence of a large boil.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 20th. Parral.</i> So far our prospects ahead
are good, and we have determined not to take the
Chihuahua route, but the mountain one from this
to Jesus Maria, and so on, as we are informed from
the best authorities that we can go that way without
suffering from want of water or food, and arrive at
the mouth of the Gila, not three hundred miles
upstream. We are told of both routes by those
who have personally travelled them, and learn
that by taking to the mountains we shall be in pine
forests, and that deer and bear are frequently
found, so that we shall be able to have some
variety from the monotonous fare of no meat or
only tough beef, which we have had for three
months.
</p>

<p>
All would have been well had we not encountered
cholera, and lost that never-to-be-caught-up-with
time at Davis's rancho; and no party would
have beaten us over. We have passed the
Comanche country, and now have to be on our
guard against the Apaches. No one knows how
constantly I miss my dear friend Dr. Kearney in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
times like these, especially when a deviation from
our contemplated route is in question.
</p>

<p>
The country we have passed through is desolate
in the extreme, parched, arid, barren, except
where irrigated.
</p>

<p>
Parral is a mining town where silver is found,
but there is no proper machinery for satisfactory
work. There are about seven thousand inhabitants
of the usual mixed variety.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 27th, 1849.</i> Here at Parral we have
found some Americans, and, as ever, friends
among them; Mr. Hicks and Mr. Miller in
particular; but here unfortunately Hinckley,
Liscomb and Teller were taken ill, and our
departure was delayed. Teller was very ill from
the first with a sort of cholera. We took him into
the town for better accommodation and rest, but
he sank rapidly; we were unable to save him, and
could only alleviate his sufferings. His cousin
and myself watched over him with heavy hearts,
and depression again settled heavily on our camp.

CHAPTER IV

<span class="s08">
ACROSS THE MEXICAN MOUNTAINS TO ALTAR</span>
</h2>

<p class="post">
<i>June 28th.</i> Left Parral at noon, leaving Carroll,
E. A. Lambert, J. S. Lambert, J. Black, Pennypacker
and Joseph Lambert to follow after burying
poor Teller. Before this we had sold our Jersey
wagon for $275.00 and I refused $250.00 for two
mules, as I did not dare to start short handed in
animals, their lives here are so uncertain. Our
start was late, not only owing to the loss of our
companion, but because the night previous we had
a severe storm with thunder and lightning, which
had drenched tents, blankets and men; many of
the men were stiff and cold, and we had to dry the
tents and blankets to save weight on our mules,
but when we did start, we wound along a glen that
led to our first view of the spurs of the eastern
chain of the Rocky mountains, and exclamations
of delight burst forth from all.
</p>

<p>
We rode until six this evening, twenty miles,
when another terrific storm coming on, we camped
on a grassy flat, among musquit and scrub oaks,
with good feeding for horses, but bad water. It
rained too hard to make a fire, so we dined on
bread and Parral cheese, not bad I assure you.
Each man was served with a tin cup of brandy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
and water. The question was brought up as to
whether or not brandy was essential, except in real
illness. As we sat in the dim light of our lantern,
drenched and cold, we decided in the affirmative,
and if our friends could have seen us, they would,
I think, have sanctioned the vote.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock I turned myself and my guard
out, and Henry Mallory and his twelve men were
my relief; the guard being unusually large, thieves
here being so numerous that guards must be
close enough to see each other, even on a dark
night.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 29th.</i> We passed through patches of
beautiful scarlet lilies, that sometimes were an acre
in extent, gorgeous and splendid, and contrasting
with an equally abundant blue-flowering plant
like larkspur, but alas, I am no botanist. We here
came to the first great ascent we had made for
some time. Had we not been told that La Zarca
was the highest point in central Mexico, we should
have thought ourselves a thousand feet higher
than at any previous time on our trip. Up we
went through scrub, post and live-oaks filled with
mistletoe, and a most beautiful laurel, with the
stems and branches bright cinnamon orange. At
last we arrived at the top of the ridge, and came
to a jutting point giving a view of the most magnificent
mountain pass that can be imagined. Our
men gave a shout for mere exultation, and I partook
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
of their buoyant spirits, and cried out: "Three
cheers for these glorious hills," and such cheers!!
Echo after echo responded, and we gazed then in
silence at the superb cliffs, volcanic, basaltic, and
sandstone, all discolored with the iron prominent
on the surface, and below us the beauties of a little
torrent that dashed on to the west as fast as I could
have wished to go.
</p>

<p>
Our course was downward now, and as we
descended the forest grew taller; laurel, pine, oak,
a wild cherry, a cedar, new to me, two feet six
inches in diameter, with balls and foliage like arbor
vitae, and bark furrowed like an ash, ornamented
the beautiful gorge; besides there were the common
cedar and many splendid walnut trees. To describe
the road would be rather difficult; it was just
passable, that is to say <i>could</i> be passed; in many
places not easy work for our packs. Most of us
led our horses, either to save them or ourselves, for
a stumble might send us two or three hundred feet
down, and was not to be risked.
</p>

<p>
Just as we reached the valley Maybury was
taken ill with what resembled cholera, and could
not ride on in the heat of the day, so Dr. Trask,
Simson, Mallory and Pennypacker remained
behind with him. The rest of us went on for ten
miles, and encamped on a beautiful, rolling prairie
under some post and narrow-leaved swamp oaks.
It rained most violently as usual, as it has done
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
every evening since we entered the mountains.
Fortunately, before it began Maybury and the men
left to care for him reached camp.
</p>

<p>
<i>June 30th.</i> A fine morning. As we had no
fresh meat we took a little bacon, our never failing
standby, and going on came to Huajatita, and
camped two miles beyond. Here we bought a six-months-old
calf for five dollars, and abundance of
corn for two dollars and fifty cents per cargo (six
bushels). I am so enchanted with the wild beauty
all about us, that I could almost stay months to
enjoy it. It is all new to me; the hills and mountains
are different in shape from any I have seen;
the plants, trees, rock, all strange, and as we take
our horses to the beautiful creek to drink, curious
fish come to look at their noses.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 1st.</i> Again our road was up hill, and most
dangerous, so most of us walked, but with all our
care nearly lost two mules, by mis-steps. The
narrow passes are so worn by the trains of pack
mules, that, to insure safe footing, each mule puts
his foot in the same worn hole that other mules
have trod, for, perhaps, fifty years previously. Two
of our train failing to do this rolled over four or
five times, and how they ever recovered their
footing is a mystery; a horse under similar conditions
would have gone to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
To us, so long suffering from drought and bad
water, the showers that come daily in the afternoon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
about three o'clock, and the little streams we cross,
are most enchanting. The ride today was very
interesting.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 2d.</i> We are leaving the mountains and I
dread the plains again, they are so monotonous.
We found some wild grapes, and, to <i>us</i>, the most
matured were not sour. Liscomb was taken ill
today with dysentery, and we feared we should lose
him. Tone put him on his horse, the easiest we
had, and Carroll was most kind to him; we were
compelled to go on, but we gave him short rests
as frequently as we could.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the plain narrowed, and as we neared
the ridge of mountains which bounds one side of
the valley of Santa Cruz, we passed the ruins of a
once beautiful Mission. It was a low, Gothic
style of architecture, built of yellowish white sandstone.
</p>

<p>
We waited in the shade of the walls of Santa
Cruz to rest young Liscomb, and the main company
wound its way along to a rancho a few miles distant
where we could get corn for the horses and mules.
I did not have time to see enough of Santa Cruz to
describe it. Like all the towns of this part of the
country, it has the remains of strong walls, that
fifty years ago gave safety from the incursions of
the Indians.
</p>

<p>
As the day cooled we took Liscomb on, and
crossed the Conchos River, called by the natives,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
of course, "Rio Grande," as they call every river
in Mexico. On reaching camp I found Langdon
Havens had killed three glossy ibises at one shot;
they are most abundant here, also white egrets and
green herons, and I was delighted to see buff-necked
Cormorants of California, and many other
birds strange and new, but no time have I to study
them, or even to secure and prepare specimens,
and how could I carry them if I had them?
</p>

<p>
I was called here to see Carroll, who while
measuring corn was taken with a violent fit, after
which he was so exhausted we had to leave him
behind with four men, and we rode ten miles
further on, and at the setting of the sun came to a
little river, with high bluffs, and most beautiful in
the light and shade given by the clouds.
</p>

<p>
Our path has been most precipitous, alternately
descending and ascending, to and from the river.
Never in any country have I seen more beautiful
lands; we rode through groves of water-oak, and
what I should call willow-oaks, with a sweet little
acorn, almost as good as a nut, occasionally pines
and cedars; and there are many little brooks, in
nearly all of which are fish, so I presume there
must be water holes all the year round.
</p>

<p>
Antelopes are seen from time to time, but only
one or two a day, wonderfully scarce for a country
apparently so well adapted for both deer and
antelopes. The black-tailed hare is seen too, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
scarce, compared to the numbers we saw after
leaving Parras.
</p>

<p>
Leaving this place we rode along a sandy bottom,
which in the rainy season is the bed of a torrent.
We left just before sunrise, and the heavy dew of
this country gave such a freshness to all vegetation
that nature seemed more luxuriant than ever. The
prairies at this season present to our view many
beautiful flowers, nearly all of a most delicate character,
like primroses, larkspurs, sweet williams.
Nettles six feet high, their blue flowers almost
hiding the rich green of their stinging leaves,
extend, sometimes, for miles along the sand bars.
The cactus seems to have been left behind. We
now found quantities of mushrooms, looking like
the same species at home, and having the same
flavor both raw and cooked.
</p>

<p>
The minerals I cannot speak of, but Dr. Trask
tells me that there is a good deal of silver, and
some gold in the earth mixed with quantities of
lead. The stone is sandstone, and now and then
we see most beautiful marbles, black and white, in
strata, as if laid by hand.
</p>

<p>
We killed three pigeons today, and have seen
many, of what I take to be either Steller's Jay or
the ultramarine, but they are so shy, we cannot get
at them. One of "the boys" gave me two young
marmots, but I cannot place them, though the spots
are a good deal like the Mexican, but not regular
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
enough for that species. The land snail, which
as far as Monterey was abundant, has gradually
disappeared, and we are now free from it. The
eatables in this country are scarce, no vegetables
except beans, onions, and a very small pea. Beans
are seventy-five cents an "Almud." Corn one and
one half to three dollars a "fanega" (nearly three
bushels). Cattle, half grown, three to twelve
dollars. Sheep from a dollar and a half to two
dollars. Hogs, strange to say, run up to eighteen
and twenty dollars, and are fattened expressly for
the lard, which is as high as eight dollars for
twenty-five pounds, and a very large, fat animal
has sold for fifty dollars.
</p>

<p>
Concepcion, about the twentieth town of the
name we have passed, is a dirty little place, with a
church and nunnery. The inhabitants are like all
other Mexicans, and are in eternal dread of the
Apaches. So far we have not seen a hostile Indian,
and only once a trail, which was that of the
"Taromari" [Taraumara]<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> tribe, and our guide
said were not Bravos. Many of the people take
advantage of us as an escort, and run along either
before or behind, and at night camp near us.
</p>
<p>
<i>July 2d.</i> We wound along the meanderings of
the river "Verde," sometimes smooth and again
a dashing torrent, and reached "El Rancho
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
Arisachi," deserted by its original owners. It is
worked by Tarimari Indians and owned now by
some one whose name we could not find out. We
tried to buy cattle, for we had had no fresh meat
for several days; but any we pointed out could not
be bought, no owner could be found. I told Van
Horn, our best shot, to pick out the fattest yearling
he could find, and we would pay the owner if he
came forward. The beast was no sooner shot than
a man claimed the price. By the time we had
dressed the animal, and packed the four quarters
on our meat mules, no vestige was seen of the dead
animal—entrails, head, etc., being carried off by
the Indians.
</p>

<p>
From this rancho we had to leave our beautiful
stream for a mountain pass, and the first precipice
we ascended cost Watkinson his horse; the poor
brute had no bones broken, but was so lame from
his fall, that we had to leave him behind. There
was plenty of grass and water in the valley near
which he fell and we hoped he would be found
and cared for, not eaten, as among these Indians is
the rule when horses or mules are broken down or
injured. In places our road was almost impassable,
but we reached the top of the first hill and had a
view of the next, about three times higher. We
could see very distinctly the zig-zag line of our
road, in the red clay between the rocks and stones,
and foresaw hard work for ourselves and our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
animals. Down we went, and in half an hour
after began the new ascent. We were compelled
to leave a mule here, and to divide his pack between
two or three other animals.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, we made the last ascent, most abrupt
and trying of all, but from the summit had a
magnificent view of a broad plain such as I have
never seen surpassed. On either hand mountain
after mountain covered with oak and pine, and
contrasts of sun and shade were before us, and the
velvety distance ended in a rainbow. After a
heavy descent we encamped on the brink of a little
creek, overhung by tall pines.
</p>

<p>
Here we saw two elks, and Jack Black, mounted
on a tired mule thought he could get near enough
to have a shot, but after going about two miles,
changed his mind.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 3d.</i> This morning we started early, and
our road along this little stream was beautiful and
so quiet that I lagged behind to enjoy it as much
as possible, but in a short time we began a stony
ascent of two miles, after which came an uncomfortable
descent into another beautiful valley, but
with poor grass; here we took a short rest, and
then continued, reaching, at noon, Tomochic, on a
little river of the same name. The old Mission
had only the original tower; the rest of the building
is now adobe.
</p>

<p>
The river here makes a sudden turn from southeast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
to northwest, and we took it up-stream; it
runs through miles of sandstone worn into cliffs
and fissures, presenting the most fantastic shapes
imaginable, delighting us at every turn. We
looked in vain for fish in the most tempting of
eddies and holes, but saw very few; little trout
about five inches long were all that rewarded our
search. We crossed and re-crossed this stream
twenty-two times in about seven miles, and
encamped on a sandy bottom covered with fine
pines. Here I saw Steller's jays and Clement shot
one for me; I also saw a fox squirrel, but I could
not get it, and do not know its species. A magnificent
hawk flew over us; he had two white bands
on his tail—could it be <i>Falco lagopus</i>?
</p>

<p>
<i>Fourth of July. Paso Chapadaro.</i> Calm, misty,
silent. The sun soon threw its red light over all
we saw to the west, but was hidden by the range of
mountains to the east which we had passed, till
mastering at an effort, as it seemed, the highest
ridge, it burst forth in all its splendor. In the
bottom of my saddle-bags, rolled in a handkerchief,
was a flag given me by poor Hamilton
Boden, and by the time the haze had gone, it
floated in the breeze, from the top of the highest
tree near our camp; nature was all in a smile, and
we prepared to spend the day according to our
various inclinations. Some slept, some basked in
indolence, some started off to look for game, some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
looked to their saddle-bags and blankets; all was
rest, at least from travel, and I unpacked my paper
and pencils and made a sketch of the "Fourth
of July Camp."
</p>

<p>
Wild cattle were abundant, and noon saw our
camp in possession of a fine heifer shot by Rhoades.
Steaks were broiled and fried, ribs roasted, brains
stewed in the skull; delicacies under such circumstances
unequalled by the cuisine of a palace.
</p>

<p>
When evening came, Mess No. 4, all good
singers, gave us some beautiful choruses from
operas, as well as simpler songs, and as night
brought the solemn quiet, and the moon glided in
its ordained course, "Old Hundred" was sung with
the most solemn feelings of reverence and adoration.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 5th. Gabilana.</i> Four o'clock saw us on
our way. We rode some hours along the valley,
rich in grass, shade-trees and springs of delicious
water; then came a steep ascent, and most of us
had to walk. We lost another mule today, but
before leaving it succeeded in getting it to the
table-land at the top of the gorge we had just
ascended. It was a beautiful grove of pines and
plenty of short green grass was under foot, and,
most welcome sight, a log house looking so like
home that a dozen of the boys rode off to see "a
white woman;" but their disappointment was
great—it was simply the house of a Mexican who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
had been in Texas some years, and had learned how
to live in a little comfort.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 6th. Santa Borgia.</i> The woods today
were most luxuriant as we wound round the gorge
that commenced again our ascent to some still
higher mountains. Our common robin was
abundant, and a large green parrot, with a red
head, was seen in every clump of pines, but its
uncouth squalling was distracting. Except the
cardinal and other gros-beaks how few birds of
splendid plumage have sweet voices.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 7th. Pitochi.</i> Today we have followed
one of the most extraordinary gorges we have seen,
crossing and winding along the banks of a beautiful
little stream, till between giant precipices we had
almost the sensation that they might tumble in to
fill the gap and crush us. One particularly fine
white cliff, we judged nine hundred feet above us;
topped off with high towers of nearly white sandstone,
its sharp lines broken by a straggling pine or
scraggy cedar, growing in some of the many
fissures, it was so grand that we left it with
regret.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 9th. Cerro Prieto.</i> I saw today the first
water-ousel I ever saw alive in America, and was
enchanted with his movements, as he jerked his
wren-shaped body with sprightly activity, or with
whirring flight went from stone to stone, or suddenly
plunged, in the most unnatural manner, into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
the foaming little torrent, and spread his wings
half open, the pinions lowest. He headed up
stream, keeping at the bottom, and went about
feeding in the crevices of the rocks with as much
ease, if not as rapidly, as a bird in the air.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 10th.</i> Early as we start, no one murmurs.
I am writing a few yards apart from Mess No. 12,
a queer lot. Rhoades, who has crossed the plains
from Fort Independence to Santa Fé eleven times,
and Barrat, a wagoner of the Mexican War, are
both very original, and perhaps would not get on
well with the others but for Dr. Trask, a truly
good man, who is their Captain. It is a misty
morning, fire more of smoke than warmth, tent
wet, blankets cold and clammy, and we are waiting
for them to dry before packing. The roll has
been called, and each mess is preparing breakfast.
I hear Dr. Trask courteously ask: "Are
those plates clean?" and Rhoades's nonchalant
answer: "To be sure they are, didn't we eat off
'em last night."
</p>

<p>
<i>July 12th. Concepcion.</i> Yesterday we passed
oaks with a heavy leaf, glazed on the top, so as to
look as rich as the magnolia grandiflora of Louisiana.
Raspberries are abundant but not ripe, and
strawberries plentiful. We camped on ground
covered with dwarf huckleberries, and a species
of plantain of which our mules ate freely, but the
horses sparsely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>July 14th.</i> We commenced our day with the
ascent of a steep rocky hill, with the trail cut in by
the mules much in the manner of those we had
seen before, and the road at first was so steep that
we had to lead our horses. One of our mules
gave out completely and we had to leave it on the
table land which is almost invariably the apex
of these mountains. A beautiful grove of pines
with short but good grass beneath, made a fine
contrast of color. As we camped our usual storm
came on more violent than usual, and we were
drenched through. Lieut. Browning says: "The
claps of thunder and flashes of lightning are very
well done in this country."
</p>

<p>
<i>July 18th.</i> Our road today was by far the most
tedious we have had, being up hill nearly all the
time, but the view from the top almost repaid us,
if not our mules, for the toil. We arrived at the
highest top near Jesus Maria; miles of mountain
tops and peaks of rock and woods are far below
us. Through a gap we looked at clouds blending
with the mists below them, until the scene was
like an ocean view.
</p>

<p>
Four hours and a half of most precipitous
descent brought us to a luxuriant growth of pine
and spruce, and passing through one of the wildest
and most picturesque gorges I have ever seen, we
came to the extraordinary little town of Jesus
Maria, situated at the junction of two little torrents
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
of clear, beautiful water, tumbling in noisy, joyous
splashing from rock to basin, and carrying away
the rubbish from this half-civilized settlement of
miners as it passes through the town.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 19th. Jesus Maria.</i> Gold and silver are
both found here, and the rock which contains these
ores is soft and easily ground; the most common
way of grinding seems to be a flutter wheel fastened
to a shaft, which turns on another within the
inner circle; this inner one is water tight, and
two large stones are pulled round by ropes of rawhide
fast to the wheel, which is about three feet
from the ground. These are trailed round and
smash the ore for two or three days; it is then
dried, pulverized and washed. Sometimes simple
washing, and sometimes with amalgam of quicksilver,
gives the result of eight to ten marks of
silver to the cargo, viz:—three hundred pounds.
Gold is much more variable in its profits.
</p>

<p>
Everything used here is brought from the
Pacific side, quicksilver, irons, wines and liquors;
even flour is sometimes brought, but most of that
comes from Sonora which is ten days' travel to
the east.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 20th.</i> There was no open space large
enough for us to picket our mules and pitch our
tents in this town (said to contain two thousand
inhabitants) and eventually we had to hire the
only corral in the place, full of fleas and dirt, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
which we had to pay twelve dollars per day. It
is only about seventy yards long and perhaps thirty
broad, so that we are very crowded. We find here
three Americans, two Swiss and one Italian, who
have for many years resided in this country as
traders. There were a number of Englishmen,
owners and superintendents of mines, who all
treated us most kindly. I think the view of Jesus
Maria which I give, supersedes the necessity of
a verbal description of its situation, but not of the
town itself, which is the place of all others that
would be selected by a man who had left behind
him enemies sworn to vengeance, for two minutes'
start up any of the mountains would insure a safe
retreat.
</p>

<p>
Yet the place has its charms; superb rocks, wild
passes, and withal a vegetation so luxuriant that
with the dozens of birds I could have spent weeks
of enjoyment, but we leave tomorrow as we have
been here two days.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 22d.</i> Leaving the public square yesterday
we took a winding alley up the precipitous mountain:
two of our mules fell off the trail; one rolled
over ten or twelve times, pack and all, and then
to our utter amazement got up, having come by
a series of falls to a small level space, and began
to eat.
</p>

<br />
<i>July 20, 1849</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
We spent four hours going six miles to where
the rear of the company encamped; thirty mules
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
and thirteen men went six miles further, and Mr.
Browning found himself with three men, four
miles ahead of all, with no other assistance, and
eighteen mules to care for. These distances between
us are the result of the unequal strength of our
mules, and one mule and a horse left behind us.
A drizzling rain came up as night fell, and we
had a miserable night.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 23d.</i> Limestone, sandstone, and huge
masses of amalgam of gravel and sand, with quartz,
have been all about us. The small plants are
numerous; ferns everywhere, a beautiful scarlet
honeysuckle is very plentiful, spruce, pine, balsam
fir, hemlock and pitch-pine are all seen; our
swamp alder grows here to great size, looking like
black beech. Raspberries are as good as in
Maine, and very abundant in many of the ravines
and valleys. The magnificent oak with glossy
leaves is here too, and a new species of reed, a
perfect miniature of our large cane of the west.
Steller's jay, a titmouse, and, I think, a crossbill,
have been seen, but no parrots such as we saw to
the east of Jesus Maria. Mists and fogs hang
over the mountains, and the air is cold and damp
unless the sun shines, and then it is very hot.
Deep, indeed, is the solitude of this grand country,
for but little animation is seen. Often as I sit
sketching or writing I hear only the chirp of some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
cricket, or distant scream of a hawk to tell me that
living things are about me.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 25th.</i> We have been feasting on venison,
here very plentiful, and much sought after by the
men, to such an extent indeed that Nicholas Walsh
having wounded a deer yesterday, which was both
misty and cloudy, followed it over hill and dale
and lost himself.
</p>

<p>
We made a large fire hoping he might see it,
fired guns and shouted, and early today he was
found by a Mexican scout; he had wandered about
for thirty hours between leaving the party and
returning to it. He had been greatly frightened,
and looked wild, when the Mexican brought him
in. He said he kept getting almost within range
of the wounded animal when it disappeared, and
heavy rain began falling which washed out the
blood of the trail which would have showed him
the way back. He thought his heart would burst
when he realized he was lost in an Indian country;
he had no idea where he was; everything was mist
and greyness; he was cold, hungry, and soaked
through, and worst of all his gun and ammunition
were wet; he was so eager not to lose sight of the
deer that he had forgotten the rule always to reload
as soon as a charge is fired, when in an enemy's
country, as the report of the gun will inform the
Indian of your proximity. He never heard one
of the guns that were fired every fifteen minutes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
from our camp, and as soon as dawn came searching
parties started in every direction, little knowing
that Walsh was trotting towards us, behind a
Mexican, in the peculiar half run of that grade of
native, when in haste.
</p>

<p>
David Hudson and I had struck far off to the
north, and had traversed table lands and mountain
paths for some miles, when just as we emerged from
a patch of oaks and undergrowth, all dead, thin,
dried, brown leaves in contrast with the full
summer bloom of everything outside this blighted
spot, we heard the tread of men, and quietly
moving behind two large trees near us, waited to
see who the newcomers were. We knew we had
heard the footsteps of more than one man, but
only the Mexican appeared at first; in a few seconds
with eyes like owls in daylight, mouth open,
hair streaming in every direction, and looking like
an escaped Bedlamite, came Walsh. He gripped
my hand so that it feels bruised yet; his first words
were: "Good fellow if he is a Greaser, have you
two dollars?" The Mexican told us he had left
the mine where he worked, to go to the rancho
where his sweetheart lived, and knowing the
country well, took a cross trail for speed and heard
a man making a great noise who seemed to want
something; he soon found him and knew at once
he belonged to our company whom he had seen
at Jesus Maria.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>July 27th.</i> We parted today with Joseph
Stevenson, one of our blacksmiths, to my great
regret. He returned to Jesus Maria where he is
going into partnership with a Mr. Williams, a
carpenter, and will no doubt make a good living
for he is a very excellent workman. I passed today
a large pine tree with the most curious display of
the sagacity, instinct, or whatever it may be called,
of some insectivorous bird, I think a red-headed
woodpecker; for I saw one a few minutes afterwards,
and he may be the workman. The bark
of the tree was perforated with holes just large
enough in diameter to hold the small acorn of this
country, say half an inch, and about as deep; the
holes were from a quarter of an inch to an inch
and a half apart; the acorns seemed all to be put
in butt end foremost, I suppose because the cone
end would turn the rain better. Should instinct
tell all this to the beautiful bird who lays up his
store in this manner so that he may go in the winter
to eat the grub that is sure to be in every acorn,
how wonderful are the provisions of Nature for
her children.
</p>

<p>
This high ridge gives a complete change of
birds; Steller's jay, so common a few days' journey
from here, is rare—indeed, I have only seen one;
the Ultramarine takes its place, and I hope in a
few days to see the Columbian; a few ravens are
to be seen, and one hawk, like our red-tailed, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
I am not sure of him. The lightning here is most
vivid, and on the sides of some of the mountains
of medium height, I found seared and scathed
patches of timber and undergrowth, as if ignition
of the electric fluid had taken place at those spots,
possibly attracted to them by the presence of iron;
if this is so, how terrific would be the destruction
to our company if such an event occurred where
we were encamped.
</p>

<p>
<i>July 28th. Paragarto.</i> We did not leave camp
until nearly noon, waiting for a train of one
hundred and eighty-two mules packed with nothing
but flasks of quicksilver; the usual length of
trains is about forty to fifty, with six or eight men.
Our road was the usual ascent and descent, and on
the second descent I saw fifteen or twenty swifts,
about double the size of our common chimney swift
at home. They appeared to nest on the cliffs
opposite to the trail, a location similar to that of
the first Republican swallow my father<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a> found near
Cincinnati.
</p>

<p>
Sundown found us in a beautiful little valley,
setting up our tents in the usual rain, and trying to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
dry ourselves by the fires of those who had
come in ahead. We have now become so accustomed
to daily rains that it is a matter of course
to encounter them. There is a rancho here with
peaches and figs in abundance. In this valley we
went again to shoeing horses; never were shoes
lost in so short a time as on these cruel trails, sometimes
they are wrenched off in a few hours, and
they commonly get loose and require nails every
three or four days. Layton and I ascended one
of the highest peaks in the neighborhood; like all
other mountain regions when one peak, seemingly
the highest, is reached, others still higher appear
between us and the desired view. Out of breath,
shoes cut, and clothes torn, we reached the foot of
the highest elevation like the cone of Vesuvius,
and found it an arduous climb; broken, reddish
traprock of all sizes made the mass, and a straggling
pine from time to time added to the solemnity
of this desolate place, which filled me with awe
and reverence, which was not decreased as muttering
thunder gave us warning that our turn
would be next, if the attractions of the mountains
the storm was already besieging, did not exhaust
the clouds. Silently, however, we struggled upwards,
and another half hour enabled us to look
to the east, south, and west as far as eye could
reach; the north was left to our imaginations,
being hid by a veil of clouds which sent flash after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
flash, peal after peal, to tell us of the storm which
held sway there. Distance lent such enchantment
to all that the valleys and slopes looked as velvety
as an English lawn.
</p>

<i>July 29, 1849</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Our descent was very rapid, but giving the usual
fatigue of a downhill march. I saw many runs of
deer, no doubt made by the bucks following the
doe, though they are still in velvet. I saw some
squirrels but could not get at them, as the stones
on which we were walking were so loose that they
would sometimes roll two hundred feet (I might
almost say yards), and made so much noise that
they startled not only them, but the deer.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the hill we both bathed in the
little torrent that waters the beautiful valley; at
times it is two or three hundred yards wide, and
again compressed so much as only just to leave
room to let the stream through. Its chilly bracing
foam sent a sparkle through us as if bathing in soda
water, and we may boast of having had such a bath
as few can enjoy, unsurpassed for its freshness,
and in the very heart of the southern Rocky mountains,
perhaps a spot never seen by any other white
men.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 6th, Trinidad.</i> The loss of mules, a
few terrific passes, and here and there a valley of
extreme beauty brought us to the western ridge of
the chain of mountains leading down to Trinidad,
a little old, worn-out place, having only some few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
hundred inhabitants, the town itself containing
some stores like those we have come across everywhere
from Davis's Rancho to Jesus Maria. At
Trinidad there are three Frenchmen, one the
Alcalde, the other two traders, dealing in everything
from horses to a single tallow candle. They
also sell quantities of muscalle, which is taken
mainly for the love of the alcohol, for any dose of
medicine would be as palatable, and in this hot
country probably more beneficial, certainly less
injurious. I asked one of the Frenchmen, now
so long a resident that he had almost forgotten his
own language, what induced him to live in such a
country. His answer was short and to the point:
"The love of gold." "Have you found it?" I
asked. "No," was his reply, "but I cannot return
without it." So it is with many of all nations, who,
lured by the stories of fortunes easily made, come
to this part of the earth and grow more and more
lazy and indolent, until they have become unfit for
the active, energetic industry requisite in happier
and more enlightened portions of the world. The
people here simply vegetate; many of them drink,
and are depraved in many ways. Some seem
happy with their Mexican wives, who, however,
are neither as handsome nor as clever as quadroons.
</p>

<p>
Nature is beautiful at every turn, now in bird
and beast, then in tree and flower, then in rock and
rill: how pained I am to pass them all by; but the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
position into which I have been forced demands
every hour, and I am never my own master.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 8th. Santa Rosa.</i> Today I passed three
partridges and two doves, warblers and flycatchers
without number, all new, and many most beautiful.
Santa Rosa where we are camped is a beautifully
situated little village, with a silver mine as its
chief interest. There are some fine horses here,
possessing more of the Arabian look than any I
have seen before in Mexico. With great regret, I
exchanged my old favorite Monterey for a mare
here worth six or eight dollars. With all my care of
Monterey, I could not save his back, and I felt as
if parting with a friend, when with his majestic
stride, his ears set forward, giving to his small
head and curved neck an expression of excitement
and fierceness peculiarly his own, he almost sailed
through our camp, and winding down a pass leading
to the village, left me gazing at the spot where
I had seen him last. There is fine grass and plenty
of water, and I was told he had gone to a kind
master, an Englishman who had drifted out here.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 10th.</i> We left our camp after great
difficulty in getting our mules together, and at six
camped again, fifteen miles only, on our way, for
it has been up and down hill all the time. The
sunny side of the hills is always very hot to us,
and trying to our poor mules. We passed many
changes of vegetation but musquit is still the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
prominent portion. One tree we saw had a large
fruit five or six inches long, hanging like a pear;
it contained seed, laid in like those of the milkweed,
and we were told the cotton-like substance
which enclosed the seeds was used for candlewick.
Here we saw the first large cacti I had seen of the
cylindrical form; some of them are apparently
forty feet high. If in a shaded situation, they
have only one or two shoots, while others in open
ground have perhaps fifty, but smaller and less
luxuriant, being only six or eight inches in diameter,
instead of four or more.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 11th.</i> Coming down the creek our
second day's descent we opened into a wide arroyo
of sometimes two hundred yards, with water
running through it, and again the water disappeared
and the dry parched bottom sent up a heat
such as I do not recollect having ever felt before.
I saw the men fag, get down and tumble on the
grass at the sides, whenever a shady spot could
be found, and the poor mules seemed completely
exhausted. Many of us became sick at our
stomachs from the effects of the intense contrast
in temperature, for we had left an atmosphere
like that of Maine, for the tropics. We saw a
storm coming up and for once wished it to hasten;
but we had no rain, only a gust of its cooling
breeze, and we gladly left our trying surroundings
for a delightful shade and green grass.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>August 14th.</i> We have had the same sort of
travelling today; we came to the Yaqui River, a
muddy stream at this season, about two hundred
yards wide and so deep that we had to employ
canoes to carry over our cargoes; the canoes are
paddled by Mexicans (no great boatmen, by the
way); the mules and horses we swam over, having
passed Tomochi [Tonichi]; the little town is said
to be four days' travel from Ures; it is about three
quarters of a mile from the river, and it is a
deserted mining place of a few adobe houses.
Here, as usual, was sold muscalle, a few freholes
[frejoles]<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> and wheaten tortillas. Only once have
I seen pulque, at a small distillery of muscalle.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 15th. Soyopa.</i> Leaving the Rio Yaqui
for its little tributaries, which are sometimes above
ground, and sometimes below, running over the
sands, or disappearing underneath them, we
encamped in a quiet cool spot, to rest after the
great heat of the sunny sides of the hills we had
left and the arroyos made by mountain torrents
where we were nearly suffocated, and we look
forward to the plains of the Gulf of California and
the sea breeze that sweeps them, with anticipations
of delight. Alas! an occasional thunderstorm is all
that gives coolness to the atmosphere here, for the
puffs of land breeze only tantalize and do not cool.
</p>

<p>
I tried here to buy or trade horses, and regret I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
did not get one I saw, but the straightened circumstances
of the company compelled me to give up
the idea.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 17th.</i> We passed a large rancho of
about a hundred and fifty men and their squaws,
for nearly all were Indians, and camped six miles
further on; but as night came on thieves came too,
whether Mexicans or Apaches I know not, but
we have never encountered bolder ones. Hinckley,
Havens, Sloat, Valentine and Boggs were on
guard, all good men, but of no avail, four double
barrelled guns and two pistols were taken, one
from under Boggs' very eyes—how, no one could
tell. We looked for the trail and found it, large
feet and small moccasins and barefooted; but the
dew was unswept from the grass outside the camp,
so the theft must have been earlier in the night: we
could recover nothing, though four of our best
men went back; so after a fruitless search of some
hours we left for Ures, and at three o'clock entered
into a series of hills and valleys so beautiful in
form and color, so fresh and green that our spring
could not equal them. Many of Cole's<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> pictures
were brought to mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>August 22d. Ures.</i> Three days' travel over a
prairie sometimes covered with chaparral, and
sometimes with grass brought us here. We are
greatly disappointed; Ures, the capital of Sonora,
with its Governor and military, Alcalde and court,
is an adobe village of about four thousand Indians,
and still they have power, and the Alcalde proved
himself a man of considerable ability.
</p>

<p>
Coming down the mountains to the Rio Yaqui,
we left coolness for heat. First we saw Turkey
Buzzards, and lower down the Carrion Crow; still
farther down we came to the table prairies and
there were the Carra Carra Eagles<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> in great numbers;
sometimes we saw fifty in a day, so that birds
mark the altitude. The mocking-bird, raven and
jay of the mountains are with us no more. I have
found the plumed partridge plentiful, one with a
black breast and guinea-fowl spots; but they are
less numerous here and I fear will soon be seen no
more. We are told gold abounds in the surrounding
mountains, but the Apaches are so bad that it
cannot be secured; however, the exaggerations of
these people are so amazing, that we do not believe
their tales; if we did it would be useless to leave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
here, as we could never live to reach our destination,
there are so many difficulties; one great one
is always with us, that is our poor mules, which
fail daily.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 28th.</i> Some gentlemen today presented
me with a large glass jar of peaches, beautifully
preserved; there must have been at least a gallon,
and we were so very grateful, for we become very
weary of our monotonous fare of coarse bread
made from unbolted flour, beef or game, half
cooked often, and eaten from tin plates or the
frying pan, and tin cups for coffee, if we have it.
</p>

<p>
We heard here one piano, but the same peculiar
nasal twang pervades the singing of the whole of
Northern Mexico.
</p>

<p>
On the journey here we lost eight mules and
horses, and but for Clement I should have been
hard pressed for the latter for Barratt. Clement
exchanged his horse for two Mexican ones, which
he procured from Mr. Gabilondo. The very next
day I heard Clement's horse was dead, so I went
at once to see Mr. Gabilondo. He said he had
sold the horse and a bargain was a bargain, and
that probably the animal had eaten something
poisonous; however, revenge was talked of by all
the men, and I found a fine looking mule in our
train very mysteriously. To my question as to
where the mule came from, I was told he had been
"traded for;" I told the man who was riding him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
that he would have to bear all risks, and he cheerfully
said he would; and so he did, for when the
owner came forward, with his brand in hand—the
voucher, in this country, of ownership—he was
told very politely that the trade had been made for
a pair of pistols (a pair that had been stolen four
days previously), and he could not return the mule
unless the pistols were forthcoming. There was
a good deal of "Carambo,"<a name='FA_22' id='FA_22' href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a> etc., but the train
moved on through half the rabble of Ures, some
of whom laughed, some swore.
</p>

<p>
<i>August 30th.</i> Leaving Ures the country is more
level; to the southeast is a large plain covered with
musquit of a different species from that on the
eastern side, and not quite so thorny; the large
cactus of the mountains is not found here, two
smaller species taking its place.
</p>

<p>
I did not leave Ures until five p. m., when the
train was five or six miles ahead of me. I rode
slowly along the swampy lane leading north from
the town, bordered with heavy hedges of reeds
and chaparral, with, from time to time, a cactus,
a palm, or a cabbage tree breaking the line of the
horizon. One tall palm, stiff and formal, was
standing out very distinctly in the soft light
between moonrise and sunset. Large flocks of the
yellow troupial in noisy bustle settling themselves
in the rushes and willows bordering the little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
stream we are now fording, brought to my mind
many an evening return home.
</p>

<p>
Two or three miles of this travelling brought me
to the first sandy tableland, and the dull monotony
of a road shut in by chaparral continued until I
came to the camp, low-spirited and tired, and
longing for the end of this toilsome journey; perhaps
the fact that Osgood, Plumb and Brown having
left us at Ures to go by way of Mazatlan with
another company, may have had more to do with
my depression than other circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Here, in the heart of the Indian country, with
the watchword "Apache," in the mouth of every
Mexican, and our guard rigid, we are toiling on
through an interesting country. The large cactus,
given by Fremont or Abert,<a name='FA_23' id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a> we met here in great
luxuriance, having a centre of pulpy pith surrounded
by a number of long hearts, one for each
ridge of the meat, or pulp, of the plant. If I
only had time, how I should enjoy making drawings
of all this, but I cannot.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>September 2d.</i> Two days out from Ures we
came to some Pimos Indians washing gold from
black ore, which they said produced well; we
found some lumps of ore in the dust, all of irregular
shapes. The value is only about one real
(about ten cents) for each bushel of dirt. Each
man made about two dollars a day.
</p>

<p>
We had fine grass and pond water here, and
are off for Altar.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 9th. Altar.</i> We reached this place
yesterday after eight days journey over barren,
sandy hills exactly like these which surround this
town. What an eight days it has been, I hate to
recall to my mind even by writing these brief
notes. Half of us are on foot, our clothes are
ragged and torn, and we have lived on half rations,
often less, of beans, and what we <i>call</i> bread. Several
days we were twenty and twenty-four hours
without water, no grass for our horses, and inexpressibly
weary <i>always</i>. Yet we are well and not
as much depressed as might be supposed, and
while we are short of nearly everything, money
included, our courage is in no degree lessened.
</p>

<p>
Altar is a miserable collection of adobe houses,
with perhaps a thousand inhabitants; there are
only one or two grandees here, but nearly all are
of Indian mixture. At one of the little villages
through which we passed, La Nada, we had all the
town about us, admiring our white (?) faces, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
asking hundreds of questions, many of the girls
had pretty Indian faces, and beautiful teeth and
hair. Great quantities of peaches grow in the
valleys and irrigated gardens, but what comfort
there is is very primitive. Plenty of the California
partridge are here, but the black-breasted
is nowhere to be seen; the California quail is found,
and Gamble's blue partridge.
</p>

<p>
I saw yesterday the most wonderful rainbow, or
rather mass of prismatic mist; a heavy thunderstorm,
one of the most furious we have encountered,
took us just as we had left a rancho, formerly
an old Mission, with a very fine reservoir two
hundred yards square, built of stone and the
exhaust arch of brick, and we rode on in drenching
rain for nearly an hour. The storm abated just
before sunset, leaving all of the west, below the
lifting clouds, of that indescribable, furious red,
which follows such blows, and the receding storm
receiving the light and blending into an immense
mass of rainbow haze.
</p>

<p>
The people here are not at all friendly to us,
and instead of having them come out to see us
at our camp, as at other places, often in such numbers
as to be a nuisance, we find them cold, and
almost uncivil. We are not looked upon with the
same interest as heretofore, and could neither buy
nor beg what we required for our use. We, however,
succeeded with some difficulty in getting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
good flour and pinole, at eight and ten dollars per
cargo. We had to make a kiln and burn the wood
for charcoal, which we needed to make horseshoes,
and we paid sixty-two and a half cents a
pound for the only bar of iron we could find.

CHAPTER V
<br />

<span class="s08">
THROUGH ARIZONA TO SAN DIEGO</span>
</h2>

<p class="post">
<i>September 14th.</i> Leaving Altar on the 10th we
crossed a desert-like plain or prairie for many
miles to the Rancho "La Sone," as usual a miserable
cluster of mud jacals and surly Mexican
vacheros, but we did not care for that. We bought
and killed one of their cattle, paying four dollars
for it; the next day the seller returned and asked
seven, which we refused.
</p>

<p>
On the lagoon near here we found the American
Avoset, long-billed curlew, and Canada crane; I
thought I saw the sandhill, but it was so far off
I could not be certain; the red-shafted woodpecker
is seen daily, and many small birds, new
to me, but not so abundant as two hundred miles
behind us. The soil of this country is beautiful
in many places, but the want of water and timber
renders it difficult to live here; the government
is feeble, and desolation and poverty show that
better days have been seen. Tomorrow we start
westward at 4 a. m. for our march to the Colorado;
how we shall get through the twenty leagues with
almost no water or grass I do not know, but it must
be done.
</p>

<p>
Some of the men hearing the rattle of the snake
of that name, in a small bunch of musquit and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
cactus, took shovels to dig him out, and after clearing
away the brush soon found the holes the snakes
live in. At about two feet down they came to a
tolerably large female, which had in her nest nine
young; beautiful little creatures, about a foot long;
they had great courage, and coiled and struck with
fury at anything placed near them.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 17th. Near Papagos<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a> villages.</i> Last
night, as for many preceding evenings, we sat down
to our supper of bread and water, our sugar, coffee
and all other matters culinary having been used
up, and the country affords no game. We all
felt the want of coffee or meat, after being up from
5 a. m. to 7 p. m., but we shall I hope, soon be
through this desolate country. Four days since
one of the party killed the largest and finest buck
antelope I ever saw, and we expected a treat, but
it was like the meat of a poor two-year-old beef,
hardly so good. We found the horns of a Rocky
Mountain sheep, and of the black-tailed deer, but
none have been killed, or even seen as yet.
</p>

<p>
The little water-holes we came to, were filled
with animalculæ, and contained many turtles and
snakes, and a few frogs and toads. For lizards this
country cannot be surpassed; one little beauty with
a banded tail runs before us and across our path by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
dozens. It makes frequent stops, and each time
curls its tail on its back, and waves it gently four or
five times most gracefully, finally retreating to
some hole in the sand, or to a thicket of cactus
which abounds.
</p>

<p>
We have met no Indians of the old Aztec race;
fifty Papagos would count all we have seen, and
they are fast passing away judging from the dilapidations
of the towns, and the numbers of empty
houses. The people live on turtles, and what game
they can get. I have seen some elk and antelope
skins dressed and terrapin shells are everywhere.
We have bought two terrapin fresh killed, some
roots, and the fruit of a plant like the maguey;
we have seen one or two fine horses, small, but
well formed, ridden with only a rope around the
neck; others had saddles; all the men ride lightly
and well.
</p>

<p>
We came to some of their burial mounds, and
saw the kettles and culinary articles of this poor
people left for the dead, to aid them on their
journey to the happy hunting grounds prepared for
them by the Great Spirit. They are happy in
their faith, and with no dissenting voices about
this method of salvation or that.
</p>

<p>
At one place just after leaving the second rancho
of Papago Indians on September 18th, we crossed
what might certainly be called a part of the desert.
Strips of red gravel a mile or two long, and two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
or three hundred yards wide, were frequently
crossed, and other strips looking like dried
parched-up white clay; the mountains are very
irregularly formed, and of a blackish stone, looking
in the distance almost purple. I tried to take
some sketches, but could not make time.
</p>

<p>
On September 19th I procured two specimens of
the <i>Dipodomys Phillippsii</i>;<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25' href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a> the red tail and marsh
hawks are abundant, and ravens are seen, as well
as buzzards from time to time. We find many
mounds of the <i>Dipodomys Phillippsii</i>, and prairie
dog or some other marmot, but they are so shy
that we have not killed one yet. We picked up
yesterday horns of the Rocky Mountain sheep,
and the Papagos tell us they are found in plenty in
the mountains around us.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 21st.</i> The last village we passed of
these Indians was situated on a large prairie of
miserably poor soil, sandy and dry, covered with
a peculiar small-leaved plant, containing a great
deal of astringent, gummy sap; we find this only
on the poorest of soils full of gravel and sand, and
always hail it with dislike, though its taste, a little
of it, is pleasant, being slightly aromatic, and yet
in some way reminding one of baked apple. Why
it is that these Indians settle in such country, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
cannot conceive, for even the lizards, in most
places innumerable, are scarce here. The Indians
kill them with a light wand, giving them a dexterous
tap on the head; they pick up the game (?),
slip the head under a belt or string round their
waists, and when sufficient are collected a little
fire is made, and this delicate repast is enjoyed by
them, as an epicure would relish his brace of
woodcock.
</p>

<p>
I am told that a sort of mush is made of grasshoppers
which abound all over the country, some
of which are very beautiful; the insects are caught
and dried, then pounded, and mixed with what
meal or "pinole" they have; the "pinole" generally
consists of parched wheat or corn, spiced and
pounded, or ground dry on the "metale," the stone
used by the Mexicans for making the meal used
for their tortillas; the dish is considered quite a
delicacy by both the Indians and Mexicans; the
man who told me this said he had tasted it, found
it pleasant, and except for the idea, a pretty good
dish.
</p>

<p>
The horses of the Indians here are very tolerable
but they are spoiled by being ridden too young.
They use them steadily when two years old, and I
saw even colts with the hair of the tail still curly,
under boys fourteen or fifteen years of age.
</p>

<p>
The houses are cones, four or five feet high and
eight to fifteen feet across, thatched in the rudest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
manner; in front of nearly every one however,
there is a shade, made by planting four poles, and
erecting on these a platform, first of sticks and
brush, and finally earth on which some plants and
grasses grow. I saw one covered with a gourd
vine falling in festoons and strings, and bearing
its hard fruit in profusion; the pleasant verdure
looked very inviting as we rode by in the broiling
sun. Two or three squaws were sitting under it,
on the palmetto mats, coarsely made, occupying
themselves with their daily avocations, some sewing
on thin cotton stuff, some preparing the food. The
women were generally large and square-faced,
with low foreheads and ugly mouths, but fine eyes;
they are generally dark, and very occasionally a
fairly good-looking girl is seen. We took an
Indian guide here, and offered him first a dollar a
day; he took the money and held out his hands for
more; two men were with him, one of whom asked
what else would we give; he was shown a half-worn
shirt; again he asked for more, a white shirt
was given him, he looked at the shirts and the
money, and pointed to a bright butcher knife; it
was given to him. He gave a smile of satisfaction,
jumped on his horse, which stood ready beside
him, pointed out the road, motioned ahead and
galloped off to his own house, some quarter of a
mile distant. Two or three of our party followed
him, myself among the number, and saw him lay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
his treasures down before his father and family;
he then put on the worn red shirt, and with a low
bow to all round him followed our company.
</p>

<p>
After a long and tedious ride over a gravelly
prairie, with many cacti, musquit and wild sage
growing on it, we passed between two ironstone
mountains, up a valley to a well of sulphur water
which was also pretty well impregnated with salt,
where all took a drink, and going over the next
ridge camped in poor grass and took our animals
back to water them at the well. Some of the mules
drank five buckets of water, one after the other
(the common shaker buckets) and the average
amount each animal drank may be put down at
three and a half. The want of water is the greatest
privation you can give a mule, as the flesh literally
seems to dry off them, and without water a mule
will rapidly fall off from being a good-looking
animal, to a skeleton; but good grass and water,
not too salt, will in a week restore them wonderfully.
</p>

<p>
On our march today we came to a dry run, what
Pennypacker calls "a thunder-shower river," and
after digging four feet found better water than we
had had for some time. We were all thirsty and
drank of it freely. I took two long draughts, and
in half an hour was ready for more, and the poor
mules had to be kept away by a guard. Some of
these "thunder-storm rivers" rise so rapidly as to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
surround camps in less time than it takes to remove
the provisions and other property, and I was told
by some of the parties we met near the Gila, that
on the El Paso route a party of General Worth's
train lost their baggage by just such floods as we
have to look out for.
</p>

<p>
Leaving this water-hole Boggs and myself
walked to the peaks of one of the conical mountains
of iron-stone, which here surround the plains;
it was bluish-black with heavy dashes of purple
intermingled for yards at a time, and looked like
huge masses of earth that had been frozen, and
were just in the crumbling state which precedes
thawing. The view from the top was very grand,
but all the scenes we had as we ascended from the
plain gave pleasure. At first the broad prairie
stretched west as far as the line of horizon; a few
feet higher on the mountain enabled us to see the
conical heads of others, and as we went higher and
higher, we saw hill after hill, and mountain capped
mountain, and the straight line which formed our
horizon at first was lost in the irregular one of
peaks of the wildest character and desolation. As
we looked north round the entire country to north
again, our eyes surveyed miles of apparently waste
barren country, without wood, water or animated
nature; one vulture alone sailed magnificently
round us, surveying us from a closer circle at every
whirl he made, his wings rustling as they glided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
past only a few feet from us. We admired his
grace and envied his power, as we watched the sun
go down, and fancied that just beyond the hills we
saw were the waves of the Gulf of California. We
descended to camp in the evening shadows and
made our meal of bread and water with good
appetites.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 22d.</i> I remained behind this morning
with one of the men to hunt up some missing
mules, so that the main party were some ten miles
on the road ahead, but we overtook them at nine
that night, and camped down without water or
grass.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 23d.</i> Daylight saw us on the march
again, and at twelve we found good grass, and
halted for four hours, leaving at sundown for the
Gila, expecting to reach it by daylight, but our
mules were so hungry we could not drive them,
and we encamped again without grass or water.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 24th.</i> At daylight again we were
off, and one o'clock brought us to the long-looked-for
Pimos Valley, with a rancho of one small house
and a few broken-down mules. However, here
we found water and a camp ground.
</p>

<p>
<i>September 25th.</i> Off again as soon as light with
ourselves and animals somewhat refreshed by a
long day's rest, plenty of corn, water and melons.
Before our arrival here we had looked forward
with pleasure to meeting others from home travelling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
our road, hoping to have news of comparatively
late date, as this valley is a sort of rendezvous;
but we have no more than we bring, we pass
and re-pass companies daily, but since we find they
have no news for us we go on with a single
salutation.
</p>

<p>
As we came unexpectedly upon the wagon trail
of the Gila route, an exclamation of joy came from
almost every one, and tired as we were we journeyed
until night in better spirits than we had
been in for some time. The old chief of the
Pimos came out to see us, and presented
letters from Col. Cooke,<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> Col. Graham<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> and
others, recommending him as honest, kind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
and solicitous for the welfare of Americans.
I gave him three broken-down mules, and some
other trifles for which he seemed grateful, but the
extravagance of the Americans who have passed
through has made it difficult for anyone to make
reasonable bargains with either Pimos or Maricopas;<a name='FA_28' id='FA_28' href='#FN_28' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a>
we had to give him a flannel shirt for a
little over a peck of corn, wheat or beans. Many
who came to trade had already made up their
minds only to do so for some particular article,
and in those cases it was not of the least avail to
offer anything else. Sometimes they would refuse
a flannel shirt in exchange for a couple of melons,
but by tearing the shirt into strips and sewing these
together, two or three times the value of the garment
may be obtained, as they are delighted with
anything resembling a sash, or bands for the head.
Jewelry had no value to them, fancy beads were
worthless, stone beads however they traded for
eagerly, but <i>we</i> had none. Red blankets and blue,
red flannel torn into long strips they preferred to
anything, though many of the women chose white
shirts; like all squaws they are very good natured.
They are dressed in a cotton, home-made sarape,
if [wearing] a garment fastened round the waist,
and leaving the whole upper part of the body
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
exposed, can be called dressed; their hair is cut
square across the forehead, and worn not very long.
</p>

<p>
We found some weed in the grass here very
injurious to our horses and mules. I lost my mare
here. Weed lost his, and nearly all ran down, so
as to be scarcely fit for use. Having now four men
without mounts, I was persuaded to buy a wagon
and harness complete, as I could get one for twenty-five
dollars.
</p>

<p>
The river bottom here forms a great flat, which
was, I think, once irrigated; at all events, it is cut
up by a great many lagoons, nearly all muddy, but
the water is not so salt in those that do not run, as
to be undrinkable; in some places the water is so
impregnated that as the water evaporates, a cake
of pure salt is deposited, and the Indians on being
asked for it, brought us five or six pounds in a
lump. It was pure white when broken, but on the
surface a sediment covered it. The country is
nearly flat, and on the light sandy soil there is
found grass, in some places very sparse and thin,
and in the others pretty good. No water but rain
water, and that at long distances apart. We find
on the few hills the columnar cactus in great abundance,
a great many of the same class of plants as
on the Rio Grande, and convolvuli without number;
they seem to live on dew. The soil of the
hills is rocky, and indeed, sometimes for miles,
chalky limestone takes the place of rock entirely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>October 1st.</i> The first rise as we enter the desert
gives the view of the plain for a great distance,
and it seems one vast waste of twenty by a hundred
miles.
</p>

<p>
The road is continuous clay and sand, so impregnated
with salt and other mineral matter deleterious
to vegetation, that sun flowers and salt grass, and
the accursed emblem of barrenness and sterility
"Larrea Mexicana," [Creosote plant] according
to Dr. Trask, are all that are seen in the way of
herbage. In places the sunflowers are marvelously
luxuriant, and cover miles of the country,
and are from five to seven feet high, the road cut
through them being the only gap in their almost
solid ranks.
</p>

<p>
The dust in this road is over the shoe tops, and
rises in clouds, filling eyes and almost choking us
as we trudge along, sore and jaded—men, horses,
mules, cattle. We stop at night, after eight hours'
travel, having made only fifteen or twenty miles;
often without food except by chance, for our animals.
Grass is only found in the good bends of the
river, which we may strike, or may not.
</p>

<p>
<i>October 3d.</i> Left at eight in the morning, and
rode fifteen miles, where we found water in some
holes; we had noticed a very heavy rain yesterday
in this direction, which had probably filled them.
We rode on until night, when we camped until one
in the morning, when, by the light of a full moon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
we re-packed and started on for the river which we
reached at eight in the morning. Resting here
for four hours, we started to make five miles or
more; necessity demanded our doing this to arrive
at good grass.
</p>

<p>
Passing along the sandy trail we saw hundreds
of the plumed partridge (the brown-headed). I
shot five in about ten minutes. I could not delay
longer, as my fast-walking little mule was too jaded
to put to the pain of going faster to catch up with
the train. These birds, at this season, seem to feed
on the seeds of the pig-weed, which is now and then
seen in patches of many acres, putting one in mind
of old potato fields. The sandy desolation of the
river bottom is beyond belief; nothing but the sand
hills of the Carolina coast can compare with it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Oct. 5th.</i> A few cotton-woods and scrub-willow,
with dried weeds, and some sunflower plants, make
thickets here and there, and this is all that is to be
seen in the way of vegetation, for about a hundred
miles below the Pimos villages, which hundred
miles we made in five days, and are now, thanks to
a placard at the forks of the road, across the far-famed
Gila, in a grassy bottom of coarse swamp
tufts, which is better than nothing, but our animals
do not seem to like it much, though they eat it, in
their starved condition.
</p>

<p>
The river here is a very rapid stream at this
season, about a hundred and fifty yards wide, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
from eighteen to twenty inches deep, with very
deep holes in places. The bottom is shifting quicksand,
delightfully varied with drift logs, put
exactly where they can best trip up the mules; as
the water is like that of the Mississippi, <i>below</i> St.
Louis, you never see the logs until you are over
them.
</p>

<p>
We look and long for Gila trout, and wild-fowl,
but in vain. I shot two blue-wings and one of our
men caught two little trout. Our road is garnished
almost every league, with dead cattle, horses or
oxen; and wagons, log chains, and many valuable
things are left at almost every camping ground by
the travellers; we ourselves have had to do the
same, to relieve our worn and jaded mules, able
now to carry only about a hundred pounds. Our
personal effects amount to about one change each,
with our ammunition and arms, all else discarded
or used up or stolen.
</p>

<p>
Opposite our camp about three miles from us,
is a hot spring of beautifully clear water; it is so
hot as to just be bearable (we have now no thermometer)
and is tasteless.
</p>

<p>
Night far on the prairie is always solemn, but
when in a doubtful country, where one is uncertain
as to the friendliness of the Indians, our watch
became one of silence and caution. We saw a
long line of regularly placed fires burn up, and,
hour after hour, could see them flare up, as fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
fuel was placed on them. We had heard that
Captain Thorn<a name='FA_29' id='FA_29' href='#FN_29' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a> with a hundred emigrants was
just behind us, and we thought this might be his
camp; but when morning came and a long line of
dark objects met my eyes as I left my tent, I wondered
if they could be mules, so regular in their
distances and march. I soon saw it was a procession
of a hundred and fifty squaws, each carrying
the provisions like a pack mule for her husband,
who, hero-like, armed with spear, shield and bow,
proudly bore himself and his quiver, made of
wild-cat, cougar, or other skin, full of arrows, on
to the wars of the Maricopas and Apaches, <i>so it was
said</i>; probably the object was to assist the Yumas
against the Americans. Of this we had no proof,
for all was quiet, owing no doubt to the good effect
produced by the appearance of the Americans, and
the prompt shooting of a party of Texans who had
shot one or two Yumas Indians for not making the
right landing. Such summary proceedings never
occurred again. We also heard that Lieut. Coats
[Couts]<a name='FA_30' id='FA_30' href='#FN_30' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a> said that he had been the main cause of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
the favorable change in the Indians towards the
Americans, especially on the part of the Yumas.
We saw many of this tribe riding their horses with
ropes in the animals' mouths, pads for saddles, and
ropes around the bodies in which they can slip
their feet.
</p>

<p>
<i>October 14th.</i> Sixteen days of travel from the
Pimos village and <i>such travel</i>, as please God, I
trust we may none of us ever see again, brought
us to within three miles of the Gila.<a name='FA_31' id='FA_31' href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a> If we
thought ourselves badly off at Altar, we are much
more reduced in every way than we were there.
The food poor, monotonous and inefficient has been
<i>forced</i> down, simply to sustain life. We have
lost more mules, of course; our wagon delayed
us at least ten miles a day, and we left it after
using it three days. We were on the "qui vive"
for Indians all the time. Lack of water and grass
we have almost come to regard as inevitable; truly
we looked, and are, a forlorn spectacle, and we
feel, I am sure, worse than we look.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
</p>

<p>
With all this there has been no useless complaining,
no murmuring, and with all our privations,
greater than I care to enumerate, or even
to think about, we are none of us ill, though a good
many feel the effects of their hardships, and are
weakened by them. John Stevens walked <i>all</i> the
way from the last Pimos village, and declares he
never felt better; Henry Mallory, Bob Layton
and I have done almost as much walking and are
perfectly well.
</p>

<p>
All along the road we have been told we could
trade with the Yumas here, but a few pumpkins
seemed to be all they had at this season, and, as
our provisions were at the lowest ebb, we left for
the crossing of the Colorado.
</p>

<p>
We had the use of a boat in the crossing, which
belonged to a Mr. Harris who came from Texas,
near Houston. It was really a large wagon body,
made into a scow, and very useful we found it;
Mr. Harris treated us with the greatest kindness,
and aided us with provisions to the best of his
abilities, and we most sincerely wished him and
his amiable wife all happiness and comfort.
</p>

<p>
We found Lieut. Com. Coats most kind and
hospitable; with the aid of his sergeant's boat, a
wagon body caulked, we crossed with everything,
in two days. I found the Indians, who swam our
mules, the fastest and most powerful swimmers I
ever saw, being able to swim round the horses and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
guide them with readiness and facility that astonished
us all; they swim over-handed. I could find
no one willing to sell or trade horses, and we are
about to start on this much-heard-of and much-dreaded
desert, having lost two mules which were
drowned after the company had crossed; they
returned to drink, and losing footing could not
regain it, and had not sufficient strength to battle
against the current.
</p>

<p>
Last evening I was invited to take supper with
Lieut. Coats, which I greatly enjoyed, for seldom
have I eaten with such an appetite, and I found the
beefsteak excellent, after being without meat for
so long a time; for some weeks we have had nothing
but an occasional partridge; meat, in the
accepted sense of the word, we had only eaten twice
since we left Altar, September 12th, to date,
October 16th, living on beans, a little rice, and as
luck would have it, sixteen pounds of flour we
bought from Mr. Stephenson at the hot springs.
Lieut. Engineer Whipple,<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a> now making observations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
at the junction of the Gila and Colorado
rivers, was very kind to me, and this evening Col.
Thorn came up with us; we had been expecting
this for some time. Col. Collins [Collier], the
collector from San Francisco treated us with great
courtesy, and I shall reluctantly bid these gentlemen
good-bye, and start across the desert with forty-six
men half mounted, one quarter the rations we
should have had, mules jaded, but the men, thank
God, all in good health.
</p>

<p>
<i>October 17th.</i> We went only two miles to our
first camp, but today came twelve up the river,
through a cotton-wood bottom; on the road we
heard that Captain Thorn had been drowned.
The canoe in which he was making his last trip,
was capsized, and one of the Mexicans, who could
not swim, seized him in such a manner that he
could not shake him off, nor hold him so as to save
him, and they went down together. So ends the
life of an officer of distinction, whose quiet, gentlemanly
manner won from me my admiration and
good-fellowship during the few hours of intercourse
we had enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
We passed one or two Indian huts, all Yumas;
they were scarcely friendly, and our trading was
very limited. I saw three about to cross the river,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
here like the Ohio when it has low banks, but
muddy. They had a float of dried rushes on which
they put their few garments; the two men stripped
without hesitation, but the squaw seemed a good
deal put out at our presence; she commenced
undoing her sarape two or three times; eventually
with a laugh and joke with her companions, she
waded into the muddy stream until the water
nearly touched her garment, and then with great
rapidity and grace removed it, the same instant
sinking into the water so quickly, that her person
was not in the least exposed; and she swam the river
fully as rapidly as her associates.
</p>

<p>
<i>October 18th.</i> We encamped a few miles
further on with nothing for our horses, and morning
saw us tramping over dust and sand, to the
sand hills twelve miles distant. When we reached
them, I mounted one of them to see how our road
lay; immediately the rolling sand hills of the
Carolina coasts were brought to mind; there was
not a tree to be seen, nor the least sign of vegetation,
and the sun pouring down on us made our
journey seem twice the length it really was.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] We encamped at the wells [Cooke's
Wells], and started out at two in the morning to go
thirty-six miles to the next grass, having given our
animals a good feed of musquit beans, which we
found in great abundance, about five miles below
us. We went on well until we came to the lagoons,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
and truly <i>here</i> was a scene of desolation. Broken
wagons, dead shrivelled-up cattle, horses and mules
as well, lay baking in the sun, around the dried-up
wells that had been opened, in the hopes of getting
water. Not a blade of grass or green thing of any
kind relieved the monotony of the parched, ash-colored
earth, and the most melancholy scene presented
itself that I have seen since I left the Rio
Grande.
</p>

<p>
We turned to our road at twelve o'clock, the
sun blazing down on us, and expecting to go nine
miles more without water; I feared the mules
would never do it, but about two miles further on,
we came to good water, and after a short rest on
we went for seven more, when we found shade,
and a good supper, for the Sergeant's guard here
had killed a wild cow, and made us a present of
part of it. The thirty-six miles had been made,
and the worst part of the road was past.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] Here we stayed one day to wait for
some of our party, who had waited hoping to purchase
provisions; they were sorely jaded, but had
not lost a mule when they re-joined us. Leaving
them to rest, I went to Col. Collins' camp for fifty
pounds of biscuit and some rice, and we then took
the way west, for the next water-hole, our horses
loaded with grass; which as it had been good, we
had taken the precaution to secure before we
started at four o'clock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] We camped at a pretty lake, shallow
but clear, and good to drink; at the back was
one of those peculiar rocky mountains so common
in this country, and I made an outline of it. Some
wagoners killed an ox, but to me it was uneatable,
so I turned in as usual, on bread and beans, and the
luxury of a cup of tea. Bachman lost his mules
here, and he and Walsh stayed until daylight, the
rest of us leaving much earlier. I have felt rather
anxious about Bachman as he is not strong.
</p>

<p>
<i>October 23d. San Felipe.</i><a name='FA_33' id='FA_33' href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a> Three days of
sunny road, and three nights of freezing cold, have
brought us to San Felipe, and a pretty valley it is,
but no water, and no wood of any consequence, still
there is enough for travellers' purposes, and the
sight of the trees gave us great pleasure, after the
dearth of vegetation through which we have been
passing. We find no food here, and most of the
company have gone to Santa Isabella, a rancho
fifteen miles distant, where they expect to get all
we want.
</p>

<p>
<i>San Felipe. October 24th.</i> My own mules
having been more heavily laden than the average,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
were very tired, and I have stayed here, leaving
Mess 6, consisting of Joseph Lambert, Ayres, Weed
and Steele five miles behind to wait for Bachman
and Walsh. The rest started with John Stevens
in charge, for Santa Isabella. I ascended the first
hill, and had a view of the long rows of cottonwoods
bordering the irrigating ditches of the once
highly cultivated, but now deserted, Mission
grounds. Desolation reigned everywhere, decayed
stumps of gigantic trees planted by hand, indications
of shrines, from the clumps of beautiful
cedars by which they are so frequently surrounded,
and other tokens of industry, told of the comfort
that had formerly been enjoyed in this lovely
valley. The hills to the east are all bare, but those
to the west have many beautiful live oaks, running
up the deep ravines that are between each sharp
ridge.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] As we rode up the valley, entering
the mountains, the contrast between the scene
before us, and the desert we had just left, was like
coming into Paradise, and we trotted along the
banks of a clear little brook, and sauntered on
through patches of wild sage and wild oats, the
first we had seen, with real pleasure. As we
reached the top of the ridge, one of those beautiful
natural parks, to be seen only in our southern
latitudes, was before us, and we had the first glimpse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
of what might be called California; the pleasure I
felt then is and will be a lasting one.
</p>

<p>
Passing the dividing line, we began our descent
following another stream, adorned on both sides
with the most magnificent California oaks and
sycamores; not so excessively large, but of splendid
form and broad spreading shade and foliage, in
full tropical luxuriance. At sundown, far down
the valley of Santa Maria, we rejoined our camp,
and found all well, and Mr. Browning treated me
to a pound or two of most delicious grapes. They
tasted so refreshing and delicious, that for a few
minutes I forgot everything else, all my anxieties
for the termination of our long and tedious journey,
with the attendant troubles and difficulties seemed
smoothed over.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] We arrived today at Santa Maria
itself, twenty miles further on our way, really
enjoying our march through this beautiful valley.
</p>

<p>
<i>San Diego Mission. November 3d.</i> We spent
the night at Santa Maria and then left for San
Diego; the country contains many lovely valleys,
and some of the hills are beautiful, and richly
covered with wild oats, possessing all but water
and wood to make it a most desirable land for the
farmer. At sundown we reached the Mission of
San Diego,<a name='FA_34' id='FA_34' href='#FN_34' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a> once evidently beautiful and comfortable;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
its gardens still contain many palms,
olives and grapes, and no doubt the plain below,
when irrigated, must have been most productive.
</p>

<p>
We found an American soldier in charge, and
as the last reflection of sunlight tipped the waves of
the Pacific Ocean with gold, and the sullen roar
of the breakers borne in on the last of the sea breeze
for that day came to my ears, tired and sad, I sat
on the tiled edge of the long piazza leaning against
one of the brick pillars in a most melancholy mood.
I could remain here a long time musing on what
is before me, realizing in the desertion of all about
me that all things mortal pass, but it is necessary to
continue our journey, as we are six miles from
anything to eat, and we know that two long hours
will be requisite to get over the distance; so we
must go.
</p>

<p>
<i>San Diego. November 4th.</i> Mr. Browning on
his fine horse "Ures" led the way, and I came
close at his heels on my favorite mule. Nine
o'clock brought us to this town; no hotel nor boarding
house, so we went to the quartermaster, Lieut.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
Murray,<a name='FA_35' id='FA_35' href='#FN_35' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a> to leave our things and find a place to
put our horses. He received us most kindly, his
wife setting before us some excellent venison, and
the first real bread and butter we had seen since we
left New Orleans, to all of which we did complete
justice. The Lieutenant apologized for not giving
me a bed, following this up by the presentation
of a pillow, and regrets that he could do nothing
better than this and his floor. I had my
blankets and was soon comfortably asleep under
the first roof I had slept under since we departed
from Jesus Maria.
</p>

<p>
Lieut. Ord<a name='FA_36' id='FA_36' href='#FN_36' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> lay next me, and this morning left
for the steamer bound for San Francisco, and I
went to the office for letters, but found none, so set
to work to get provisions ready for the company.
</p>

<p>
Five miles from San Diego is the bay, beautiful
enough on one side, but opposite are long islands of
flat land, and the view ends in distant hills far
below, no doubt the coast line. Here I saw many
old acquaintances among the birds, the brown pelican
wheels and plunges for his prey, as on the
Gulf of Mexico, terns, curlews (the long-billed),
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
the California black-bellied plover, and great numbers
of the horned grebe. I killed two of them,
and left them with Mr. Murray, as I carried my
gun when I went to the fort for our provisions,
which were stored in old hide warehouses. The
traffic in hides and jerked beef has been for many
years the great industry at this place.
</p>

<p>
I rode on to our camp in the rain, the first we
had had for some weeks, and though now cold,
and chilling us to the bone, we would have given
worlds for it a short time previously, whilst crossing

CHAPTER VI
<br />

<span class="s08">
CALIFORNIA FROM SAN DIEGO TO SAN FRANCISCO</span>
</h2>

<p class="post">
<i>San Diego. November 6, 1849.</i> We started for
Los Angeles at ten this morning, leaving behind
Havens, Sloat, Watkinson, Lee, Snider, Perry, Dr.
Trask, Steele, Bachman, Stevens and Cree, to follow
by boat; Cree remained at my request to take
care of Stevens, who is seriously ill, and Bachman
is not strong enough to march further.
</p>

<p>
The road from San Diego is a pleasant one;
northwest over a few moderate hills brings the
traveller to the edge of a large bay, which from
its appearance seems to be shallow; to the west,
mountains, not the Coast Range, and a few miles
along this bay, a beautiful "hollow" rather than
valley, opens, and after six or eight miles leads to
some steep and disagreeable hills, where our first
night from San Diego will be passed. I did not
regret leaving San Diego, except for the kindness
received there (it is a miserable Mexican town)
and our own rather forlorn condition. About forty
men continue with me, half of us on foot, the other
half scarcely much better, as our animals are woefully
jaded, but we could not stop, for we are even
worse off for funds than for mounts, as we have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
only about four hundred dollars, for all our
expenses, for over six hundred miles. But our outlay
will be small, for with all the assistance of the
officers, which has been most liberally given, we
have only secured half rations of flour and pork;
we are so accustomed to doing without sugar and
coffee, that we scarcely care for it.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 7th.</i> We were off at daylight
according to custom, and followed the trail over
hill and hollow, with an occasional valley. At
times the ocean was in full view, its soft blue horizon
line melting into the clear, cloudless sky. To
our right, high over the Mission of St. Louis del
Rey, smiled, glistening in snowy purity, the highest
peaks of the Snowy Mountains, Sierra Nevada.
The soil is black loam, and the bottoms still
blacker, but on this day's travel much of the soil
has been salt.
</p>

<p>
Seeing a few ducks alight at a little lake, almost
like a running stream, I went after them, and found
some hundreds of gadwalls, and bald-pates, and
in half an hour had sufficient for all our company,
which I need not tell you we enjoyed, though not
cooked at Baltimore "à la Canvasback."
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of California marmots are seen daily,
at a distance looking like a common squirrel, so
much so that the men all call them squirrels; their
color varies very much, being every shade of grey
and reddish brown.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Mission of Luis Rey,<a name='FA_37' id='FA_37' href='#FN_37' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a> as it is now called,
now in the possession of the Americans, is kept by
an old Mexican; it presents, as you get the first
view of it going north, one of the most impressive
scenes I can recall; its long row of low, but regular
arches, the façade whitewashed, and the church
at the east end, with many outlying buildings
covered with red tiles, the whole standing in a
broad valley running eastward for miles, until the
view ends in the snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada,
compels the traveller to pause and to admire.
</p>

<p>
As we stood looking at all this, from a hill higher
than the one on which we were, swooped a California
vulture, coming towards us until, at about fifty
yards, having satisfied his curiosity, though not
mine, he rose in majestic circles high above us, and
with a sudden dash took a straight line, somewhat
inclining downwards, towards the mountains
across the valley and was lost to sight, from actual
distance.
</p>

<p>
The garden of the Mission has been beautiful,
and we found it still well stocked with vines, olives,
figs, etc., but the same desolation is visible everywhere
through this country of splendid soil, which
here is rather sandy. There is still lack of wood
and water, irrigation has been universal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Missions seem to have been divided into the
residence, with beautiful gardens, the church, the
stock farm and the grain-growing lands, and all
have possessed much comfort if not considerable
wealth. Naturally those who lived in them wished
to isolate themselves from the world, and to surrender
the pleasures and ambitions found there,
for the advancement of their religion, or, at least,
were willing to do so.
</p>

<p>
<i>November 9th.</i> I have already seen the nucleus
of an American rancho, in this country, which is
lonely rather than desolate. We have passed
many fine old Missions, at least six or seven, but
though in the midst of beautiful land, with hundreds
of horses and cattle, and many herds of sheep
and goats, the indolence of the people has left all
decaying, and they live in dirt and ignorance, and
merely vegetate away this life in listlessness, except
for the occasional excitement of a trade in horses,
or a game of monte. We have had many melons,
late in the season as we are; they are pulled and
put up as the French do pears, and keep fresh for
many weeks.
</p>

<p>
All the people here ride well, and fast, many
without saddles; these latter tie a rope, or if they
have it, a surcingle, buckle that around the body
of the horse, and stick both knees under it, so that
it is a great assistance to them. The gallop is the
usual gait at which they travel. The continual
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
absence of wood gives an appearance to all the
hills, of old fields, but many of the valleys are
truly beautiful; fine sycamores, oaks and cottonwoods
along the water making everything look
refreshing to a degree that none can realize but
those who have been for weeks exposed to sun and
rain, keen winds and cold nights, without woods
for shelter or fire; in cooking we have often had
to keep up a fire with weeds, some men attending
to this, while the others fried our meat, made
coffee, and what we <i>called</i> bread.
</p>

<p>
<i>Los Angeles.</i> This "city of the angels" is anything
else, unless the angels are fallen ones. An
antiquated, dilapidated air pervades all, but
Americans are pouring in, and in a few years will
make a beautiful place of it. It is well watered by
a pretty little river, led off in irrigating ditches
like those at San Antonio de Bexar. The whole
town is surrounded to the south with very luxuriant
vines, and the grapes are quite delightful; we
parted from them with great regret, as fruit is such
a luxury to us. Many of the men took bushels,
and only paid small sums for them.
</p>

<p>
The hills to the north command the whole town,
and will be the place for the garrison.
</p>

<p>
San Pedro, twenty-seven miles south-west, is the
port, and is <i>said</i> to have a good harbor. All the
country round is rolling, and in many places almost
mountainous. Before you get to the Coast Range
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
the soil is most of it very good, and the cattle are
fine; wild mustard grows everywhere, to the
height of five feet or more; in the richest soil
attaining seven and eight feet, and we have twice
cooked our meal with no fuel but the stalks of this
weed.
</p>

<p>
We have had great trouble with our mules for
want of grass, and the poor things wandered miles,
and we lost some few, and had difficulty in getting
the others. After long consultations we decided
to divide, eleven of us to bring on the mules and
take the valley of the Tulare for our route; the
rest of the company under Henry Mallory going
up in the barque Hector for thirty dollars each, as
our mules are utterly broken down, and we want
to get them through to San Francisco if we can.
So much for our splendid outfit, so much for the
plans of our Military Commander. But let it pass,
and I will try to describe our route.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] Leaving Los Angeles at one o'clock,
with forty-six mules and ten men, I making the
eleventh, and two of the number being my true
friends Browning and Simson, we passed eastward
of the town, and followed the little river of the
same name, and camped on the best grass we had
had, and with so good a beginning, expected to
have the same for our poor animals for the rest of
our journey, and in some degree recruit them and
heal their sore backs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] Today our ride of about eighteen
miles was over a plain of rather poor soil, and we
found the rancho; it was formerly the Mission of
San Fernando.<a name='FA_38' id='FA_38' href='#FN_38' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a> Like most of the others, it has a
long portico and arches; a few pictures of the
Virgin and some images of the saints are still
standing, but, from an artistic point of view, they
are poor trash. The garden is still most luxuriant,
and many grapes are grown here, and wine made,
as well as other liquors distilled. It looked like
sacrilege to me to see the uses made of sacred places
but so the changes appear to be in these countries;
dilapidation immediately follows the removal of
the priests. Great dislike was manifested to the
Americans here, and they would neither give nor
sell any of the fruits they had in such abundance,
grapes and melons wasting on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Leaving this rancho we camped five miles
further on our way, up an arroyo, in tall, rush-like
grass, where we had only bad water, being so
charged with sulphur and various salts as to be
undrinkable. The hills are of a friable, whitish
clay and sandstone, and after a very steep ascent,
we gradually descended into a beautiful valley to
the rancho San Francisco, and encamped in sight
of it with good water, and plenty of wood. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
morning Rhoades killed the first black-tailed deer
that any of the party has secured. We found it
very good meat, and quite enjoyed it, after the
continuance of beef we have had since our arrival
on this side of the great divide, as at the rancho we
can usually buy fine, young cattle for from eight to
twelve dollars.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] We now commenced the regular
ascent of the Coast Range, the mountains at first
were sandy loam and sandstone; we had no grand
views, even of distance, and we lost two of our
mules from fatigue. Our descent was rapid for
some miles, and brought us to the gorge leading to
the dividing ridge, where was a rapid torrent,
about up to our knees, and as we followed it scenes
of the wildest description presented themselves.
Sometimes it looked as if our further progress was
completely at an end, and again a turn at right
angles showed us half a mile more of our road.
The rocks here are shelly sandstone, looking at
first sight, at a distance, like slate. The tops of all
the mountains are covered with snow, and the wind
from the northwest was blowing so hard as to bring
our tired mules to a standstill, as the puffs struck
them.
</p>

<p>
As we came out into the plain or valley a few
squalls of hail and rain came on, and we were glad
to camp near some cottonwoods, not deeming it
prudent to be under them, as their limbs had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
already, some of them, yielded to the mountain
gusts and fallen.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] <i>Tulare Valley.</i> One more day
brought us to this great valley, and the view from
the last hill looking to northwest was quite grand,
stretching on one hand until lost in distance, and on
the other the snowy mountains on the east of the
Tulare valley. Here, for the first time, I saw the
Lewis woodpecker, and Steller's jay in this country.
I have seen many California vultures and a new
hawk, with a white tail and red shoulders. During
the dry season this great plain may be travelled on,
but now numerous ponds and lakes exist, and the
ground is in places, for miles, too boggy to ride
over, so we were forced to skirt the hills. This
compelled us sometimes to take three days when
two should have been ample. Our journeys now
are not more than twenty miles a day, and our
nights are so penetrating and cold, that four
blankets are not too many.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] Our morning's ride, as we had
anticipated, was pleasant after the hills, but not
directly on our course, as the late rains had made
the soil, always soft, impassable for our mules,
from the mud. We wound round the mountains
for about twenty-five miles, to the first Indian
village we had seen, though we had passed several
single huts. Being far ahead of the train, I had
time to look at their household style of living, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
saw them grinding their acorns, and fanning grass
and other seeds, so as to prepare their winter's food.
They appear to make a sort of pulp of the acorn
by grinding it in a most simple mill of stone, using
two kinds as convenience or ownership suggests.
One, a standing mill, and the other a kind of
mortar and pestle style, the mortar being formed
by continual use of the same place, until from two
to six inches deep, and if the large stone is favorable,
from ten to twelve holes are seen in the same
one.
</p>

<p>
These Indians were friendly and seemed pleased
to see Americans coming into the country, and I
have no doubt but that their condition will be
greatly ameliorated by the change from savage to
half-civilized life.
</p>

<p>
We saw one company already installing themselves
in this beautiful valley, where they hope to
make permanent homes.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] For two days heavy rolling hills
of black soil, clay and gravel with an occasional
arroyo of sand, made our journey tedious, but we
gradually arrived in better country for travelling,
but less grass, and, as we neared the San Joaquin
River, immense herds of antelope and elk were
seen, so wild that it was difficult to approach
them.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] This is our second day on the San
Joaquin River, and we have secured a fine elk and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
an antelope, three geese and two Sandhill cranes
(I am sure different from ours) so that we have
feasted luxuriously. Many thousand geese are
seen daily, and we are travelling on cheerfully,
making our twenty-five miles with ease, and camping
by half-past four or five o'clock. After supper
we sit round our camp fires for an hour or so, and
then turn in for the night, to be ready for the
early start on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
The nights here are in great contrast to the days,
and are exceedingly cold, for all the icy mountains
send their damp air down, as the sun sinks behind
them.
</p>

<p>
Following down the San Joaquin southwest and
west, we came to the river of the lakes, and stood
off northwest (its general course) for nearly two
days, but were so impeded in our progress by the
bull-rushes that we turned aside to a clump of
trees, where we expected to find water and grass;
but not succeeding, returned to the river, about
eight miles, and with great difficulty reached the
edge of it for water at dusk—cold, tired, and
regretting our lost time. We resolved, nevertheless,
to steer off from the rushes next day. This is
the locality from which, I suppose, the valley takes
its name, "tulare" meaning "rush," this plant
taking here the place of all others.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] Today I ran on to a herd of about
a thousand elk; so close was I that I could see their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
eyes perfectly; these elk must be greatly harassed
by the wolves, which are very numerous, and so
bold at night that we have had several pieces of
meat, and a fine goose stolen from over my tent
door. Their long, lonely howl at night, the cries
of myriads of wild geese, as well as Hutchinson's
goose (which is very abundant) and the discordant
note of the night heron, tell the melancholy truth
all too plainly, of the long, long distance from
home and friends.
</p>

<p>
There is no trail but that of wild horses and elk,
all terminating at some water-hole, not a sign of
civilization, not the track of a white man to be
seen, and sometimes the loneliness and solitude
seem unending.
</p>

<p>
The water is beautifully clear now, and is full
of fine-looking fish; the large salmon of these
rivers is a very sharky-looking fellow and may be
fine eating, but as yet we have not been fortunate
enough to get one, though several have been shot
by Hudson and Simson as they lay in the shallows.
The average width of the river here (that is, two
days' journey from the mountains) is about eight
yards, but as the snows are high up on the mountains,
no doubt a great portion of the water is
absorbed by the sandy soil it runs through.
</p>

<p>
Among the oaks the long acorns of two shapes,
a good deal like nuts in taste, but still astringent to
a disagreeable degree, are plentiful, and we eat a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
good many of them both roasted and raw, by way
of variety, though objecting to the flavor. I have
seen one or two nearly three inches long. Out of
these acorns the Indians make their "payote," a
kind of paste, which they dry, and then put into
water in flakes, no doubt to allow the acrid matter
to escape.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] <i>Stockton.</i> For the last five days
we have passed over vast plains of sandy soil and
all the recollections of the desert would come upon
us, but for our nightly returns to the river. Passing
two small rivers, we came to the Stanislaus, and
went down it to the ferry, having once tried, unsuccessfully,
to cross it. We had to pay a dollar each
for about twenty yards, and went on our way to
Stockton.
</p>

<p>
This mushroom town of skeleton houses and
tents, with every class of dwelling from log cabin
with rush roof, to the simple blanket spread to
shelter the hardy miner, is situated like Houston,
Texas, on an elevated flat, so level, that the water
lying after every shower, makes the mud as deep
as I ever saw it on the rich levees of Louisiana in
winter. I find the climate much the same as that
in Louisiana, but without the beautifully luxuriant
vegetation of that country, and from all accounts it
is quite as healthy, except that the high mountains
here give a pleasant retreat in summer from the
diseases incident to that season.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I left the men at the "French Camp," the first
prairie out of the water, five miles to the south-west,
and came into Stockton, with Hudson and Boggs
and a pack mule to take out provisions for those at
the camp. We went into the "Exchange Hotel,"
which might better be called the "Exchange of
Blacklegs." Such a crowd as the bar-room of this
hotel presents nightly, cannot be found except
where all nations meet. Cards were being played
for stakes every where, and the crowd around
added to the picture, which once seen is difficult
to forget. The tall, raw-boned Westerner, bearded
and moustached like his Mexican neighbor beside
him, the broad-headed German and sallow Spaniard,
French, Irish, Scotch, I know not how many
nationalities are here represented. I saw even two
Chilians with their cold, indifferent air, all mixing
together, each man on his guard against his fellow-man.
The tight fitting jacket and flowing sarape
touch each other, all blending into weirdness in the
dim light of a few candles, would that I had time
and opportunity to sketch some of the many scenes
I beheld.
</p>

<p>
Having bought what we required we made our
way back to camp through the dark dismal night,
wind blowing and rain falling in torrents.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] Today we went up to Stockton
again, the approach is through mud and mire, or
rather water, reminding one of that at Houston
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
from the south; the mud, if anything, more disagreeable
to walk through. One wonders at the
way in which men stay here day after day, gambling
going on incessantly. Of course, the sharpers
and experts get all the money, the poor dupes
continue to put down gold-dust, even though every
boat that leaves takes away professional card-players,
and <i>they</i> have to return to the mines to dig.
The craze for the mines is beyond all credence;
mechanics refuse sixteen dollars a day, to go to the
mines where half an ounce is the regular gain,
though sometimes ten times that amount.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] We leave tomorrow for San Francisco;
today I made a sketch of the east suburb of
the town, and as a proof of the good intentions of
the people to be honest, and keep up good principles,
a gallows is the chief object in the foreground.
It was erected to execute a man for murder and
robbery.
</p>

<p>
A party here got up a club called the "Hounds,"
at first as a patrol, and were of real service, but
later bad habits crept in, such as knocking up any
bar-keeper at any hour of the night and making "a
night of it." For some time they paid for this on
the following day, always saying as they went out
"To the charge of the Hounds," but at last the
"charge" became the last of the matter; eventually
thefts were committed, and the thief was convicted
by a regular jury, and sentenced. The day for his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
execution came, and he felt assured that he would
be rescued by his friends, and probably would
have been, but for the arrival of a ship-load of
emigrants, who, on being informed of the fact,
marched out, fully armed, to see the law carried
into effect.
</p>

<p>
The prices of everything here are beyond belief;

and almost every other article in proportion; for

$16.00. Yet with these high prices scarcely one
becomes rich. Board $3.00 to $6.00 a day, without
lodging. Washing and ironing $6.00 a dozen.
</p>

<p>
We are in a forlorn condition, almost without
clothes, and our mules broken down, yet wretched
as we are no company coming by land has done
better, and mine is only the second yet holding
together. This shows how honorable the men are,
for [with] wages from $5.00 to $10.00 per day,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
and mechanics (of which our company has several)
[getting] from $10.00 to $16.00, these men
stand by their contract.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] We none of us regret leaving Stockton,
where we have been for four days delayed by
the steamer, our ill-luck as regards waitings still
follows us. We are going in the steamer Captain
Southern. [?]
</p>

<p>
<i>San Francisco. December 23d.</i> The day we
left Stockton we had one of the most violent gales
I had seen for many a week, and our boat, a little
steam side-wheeler, was so flat and so light that
the strong wind from the south-east had us ashore
twenty times in the first hour, on the banks of the
slough which leads to the San Joaquin, the main
stream leading to the upper bay, Suisun; finally
anchors and all were dragged high on the bulrushes,
and we were delayed two days more.
</p>

<p>
We reached San Francisco on Saturday night
December 21st, and stayed in our blankets on the
floor of the steamer until morning when we went
off, on what is called "the long dock" into mud
half-leg deep. We paid fifty cents for a cup of
coffee and a bit of bread, and I went for my letters,
but found none, so went off to hunt up my men,
found them all right, and returned to Henry Mallory,
who having received letters was able to set
my anxieties about my family at rest; but I alone
of all the company had no home news. I sat on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'></a></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
the deck of the steamer, the most quiet place I
could find, re-read my old letters, and went about
my business with a heavy heart.

<p>
<i>San Francisco. December 25th 1849.</i> Christmas
Day! Happy Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Not that here, to me at any rate, in this pandemonium
of a city. Not a <i>lady</i> to be seen, and the
women, poor things, sad and silent, except when
drunk or excited. The place full of gamblers,
hundreds of them, and men of the lowest types,
more blasphemous, and with less regard for God
and his commands than all I have ever seen on the
Mississippi, [in] New Orleans or Texas, which
give us the same class to some extent, it is true; but
instead of a few dozen, or a hundred, gaming at a
time, here, there are thousands, and one house
alone pays one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
per annum for the rent of the "Monte" tables.
</p>

<p>
Sunday makes no difference, certainly not
Christmas, except for a little more drunkenness,
and a little extra effort on the part of the hotel
keepers to take in more money.
</p>

<p>
I spent the morning looking over my journal,
and regret it has been kept so irregularly, yet, as I
read it, and recall my experiences since last March,
I wonder that I have been able to keep it at all.
I dined with Havens, Mr. McLea, Lieut. Browning
and Henry Mallory, and you may be sure
home was in our thoughts all the time, even if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
other topics of conversation were on our lips. It
seemed impossible for me to shake off my depression.
</p>

<p>
<i>December 26th.</i> I was not made more cheerful
by finding that our agents had so conducted our
affairs that instead of finding all our provisions
and implements nicely stored, and in good order,
waiting for us, I discovered that all that was most
useful to us had been sold, and the balance lay
about in the wet and mud, or was rotting, half dry
for want of the requisite cover. The expenses had
eaten up the money procured by the sales, or so
we were told, and I found myself with forty men
to take care of and in debt. I was on the point of
breaking up the company, and letting every man
shift for himself, but felt that it was neither brave
nor honorable, so decided to make one more effort.
I drew on my brother for one thousand dollars,
borrowed all I could from the boys who had
brought their own mules on with them, and
concluded to take all who were not mechanics with
me to the mines; the mechanics had, without exception,
found work instantly at exorbitant prices.
They were to keep half they made, and pay in the
other half to the company. I have been offered
thirty-five dollars a day to draw plans for houses,
stores, etc., but though I never intended to go to
the mines myself, I feel now for the sake of the
men who stood by me, that I must stay by them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
My paints and canvas have been left on the desert,
my few specimens lost or thrown away; and lack
of time, and the weakness produced by my two
illnesses at Monterey and Parras, and the monotonous
food, have robbed me of all enthusiasm; often
I had to force myself to swallow the little I did,
knowing I must if I was to get through at all.
</p>

<p>
Van Horn and Dr. Perry will remain in San
Francisco and the men who go up to the mines with
me, are Havens, Layton, Hewes, Bloomfield,
McGown, Lee, Watkinson, Jno. R. Lambert, Jos.
Lambert, J. S. Lambert, Hutchinson, Damon, Jno.
Stevens, Cree, Van Buren, Ayres, Hinckley, Jno.
Stevenson, Black, Liscomb, Elmslie, E. A. Lambert,
Dr. Trask, Steele, Weed, Henry Mallory,
Mitchell, Walsh, Valentine, Simson, McCusker,
Tone, Hudson, Pennypacker, Clement, Boggs,
Lieut. Browning, with myself, thirty-eight in
number.
</p>

<p>
<i>December 29th.</i> We left San Francisco in the
same steamer we had travelled on from Stockton.
The week's rain over, with the bay like a mirror,
and a clear sky over all, it was an enchanting scene.
I thought with gratitude of the kindness I had
received from Messrs. Chittenden, Edmondson,
McLea and many others; not only had they frequently
made me their guest, but they had given
me most valuable information and advice, in
reference to my future proceedings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As we moved off I could see the whole town
situated on high hills facing the bay, to the southeast
on one side, to the southwest on the other. I
could almost fancy as we made our way to the open
bay through the crowd of vessels, that I could hear
the chink, chink of dollars as the gamblers put
them down on the Monte tables, and a picture of
the whole place, a regular Inferno, came before
me as plainly as if I actually saw it. Every house,
with rare exceptions, letting out their bar-rooms
as well as all other available space, for gambling
purposes, immense rents being paid for a mere
shell of a house. In some of the hotels one hundred
dollars a day was paid for space to place a
single Monte table; but I will leave all this, and
sail on over the beautiful bay towards the east,
which sends the gold that makes this hell-hole of
crime and dissipation.
</p>

<p>
Passing out of the mass of shipping to the left,
opens out the pass to the ocean, and ahead of us,
surrounded by beautiful hills, smooth but steep,
green and velvety to look upon, a few tall redwoods
ended the view to the south. The water was as
smooth as a lake, and the moon rose on so calm a
sheet that its reflection was a long, straight line of
light, almost as brilliant as itself, and I sat late on
the deck to admire it, and to think of all at home,
but at last went down to the filthy cabin, wrapped
myself in my blankets and lay down in a corner
possibly a shade less dirty than the others.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We reached Stockton, and after a day in the
mud I found my goods stored safely and all ready
for packing, Mr. Starbuck to whom I had entrusted
them having been most faithful. We went
to the hotel for supper which was worth, perhaps,
ten cents, but cost a dollar and a half each. After
which, with Browning, Simson, Stevens, Bloomfield
and some of the others, I took a look up and
down the town. The gambling was going on as
usual, the tables had changed hands in some instances,
but the many are still sitting behind their
"banks." A young English nobleman, who asked
me to keep his name a secret, laughed and said:
"We are all <i>bankers</i> here." One young man, too
young for such work, terrible at any age, I felt
sorry to see; he had evidently been a winner to
judge from the large amount before him, having
a wall of gold dust ounce high and three rows deep,
leaving a space of nearly a foot square inside, well
filled with gold pieces of all stamps and countries,
the 16, 8 and 4 of the Spanish, the eagles and
half-eagles of the United States, sovereigns and
half sovereigns of England, and others from
apparently all over the world, lumps even of
unalloyed gold, had all fallen into his hands today.
He seemed quite alone; his candles were still
burning, and he rested his cheek on a delicate, well
formed hand, which looked as if it had not been
made for the shovel and pick of the mines. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
was a very handsome young fellow, I should judge
from Virginia, with a profusion of half curling
light hair and deep grey eyes. Suddenly he rose,
looked about him, and said in a quivering voice:
"Well, I came here to make my fortune, I've made
it, there it is, but, Oh God, how can I face my
mother." He burst into tears and dashed from
the room, which for an instant was in absolute
stillness. Two men came up, spoke to the banker
[?] in low tones, swept the gold into two canvas
bags and followed the youth, or so I presume.

CHAPTER VII
<br />

<span class="s08">
A TOUR OF THE GOLD-FIELDS</span>
</h2>

<p class="post">
<i>January 2d, 1850.</i> Leaving Stockton we tramped
through mud and water, so like the coast of
Louisiana (the Mississippi) that it might have
been winter there, instead of in California. We
had packed the day before leaving, so left early
for our walk of twenty miles after our pack-mules,
and went over a partially sandy prairie to the
Stanislaus River, and at eight that night reached
good wood and water, and encamped about three
miles from the river. Next morning, January 3d,
we left in the rain for the ferry, but owing to the
bad weather, heavy roads and exhaustion of Bachman
and McGown, stopped at a good camping
ground, with excellent grass, after going only three
miles. The rain poured all day and all night, and
we lost two days here in consequence, for the river
rose so rapidly that we could not cross our mules.
The next day the most of us did get over, and
Clement and Hudson remained behind to look
after the mules.
</p>

<p>
<i>January 6th.</i> Leaving the middle ferry, known
as Islip's, our first day was over a good road with
occasional quicksands in the way. The next day,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
January 7th, 1850, as we had a cold northeast
drizzle, we lay by, and the following morning,
January 8th, left for our destination, the Chinese
Mines. Many of the views before us, as we
mounted hill after hill looking towards the mountains,
are very beautiful park-like country; the
roads are a series of mud-holes and quicksands at
this season, and the trees, either swamp, or post-oak,
with occasionally a fine ridge of a species of live-oak.
At times we had to pack the cargoes of the
weaker mules, every few hundred yards, and at one
place, had nine mules mired at the same time, the
mud being so tenacious that even when the packs
were taken off, the poor animals could not get out
without our help. Three days of such travelling
brought us to our present camp, the soil red clay
and sand, mixed thinly with white quartz of various
sizes, but generally small, not more than two,
or at most, three inches in diameter, and generally
even smaller.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date</i>.] We went up to the "diggings"<a name='FA_39' id='FA_39' href='#FN_39' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a> on
the morning after our arrival, and looked round to
see what prospects were ahead of us. We found
the little branches bored, and pitted, and washed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
out in every direction, so much so that we tried to
"prospect" for ourselves, and we lost three days.
We found the men already there kind and polite,
showing the mode of working and washing, of
digging and drawing most willingly, and tomorrow
open a pit close beside some of the most
fortunate.
</p>

<p>
The uncertainty of digging renders the life of
the miner, for profit, that of a gambler, for most
of his good luck depends on chance. At times you
may see two pits side by side, one man getting two
ounces a day, and the other hardly two dollars:
we heard of one instance of much greater disparity;
two friends working next each other found that at
the end of the week, one had an ounce of gold,
worth about twenty dollars, the other gold worth
six thousand dollars. So it goes, and we shall all
have to work hard. Again and again I am overwhelmed
by the thought that I am at these dreary
mines—I, who started intent on drawing and
obtaining new specimens—to have so different a
destiny thrust upon me, is bewildering.
</p>

<p>
The ground here is beautiful rolling valley of
sandy clay, so like the post-oak country of Texas
that one might almost fancy himself there. A few
pines are scattered about, the cones are very large,
say six inches long, and three in diameter; the seed
is a pleasant nut, about the size and shape of a
small, shelled almond; the quantity of resin contained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
is very great, and at the end of every leaf
of the cones, quite a lump is seen.
</p>

<p>
The ultramarine jay, and Steller's, the red-shafted
woodpecker and California quail are abundant,
and many finches, some new, and others that I
know, are everywhere; but I have no time to skin
and preserve specimens. Then too, the black-tailed
deer, California hare, and grizzly bear, are
common, as well as the small hare. There are
some few squirrels and a marmot or two, but I have
not been able to procure them; I have also seen
the robin of this country and many others. The
country is otherwise barren, I wish I was out of it.
</p>

<p>
<i>January 20th, 1850. Chinese Diggings.</i> It
does not seem possible, remembering the difficulties
of the road, that we are only seventy miles from
Stockton. The men began "rocking" yesterday,
one cradle, and get about a dollar an hour, but
hope to get more when in the way of it. Those at
work around us get an average of fourteen a day,
and at times much more; then again a week's work
is lost. The quantity of gold, so I am told by those
who know more of it than I do, is very great, but so
diffused that great labor is required to get it. The
lottery of the whole affair is beyond belief. The
richest gulches are supposed to be those on the river,
the Tuolome [Tuolumne], or the creeks leading to
the river. The pit, or piece of ground allotted to
each man is sixteen feet square, this having been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
settled by the diggers, and the law is enforced by
an alcalde. Many is the week's work, the men
say, when they do not get the price of their board,
and again large amounts are found. One individual
told me he was getting two ounces a day,
and gave his claim up, to join a company in digging
out the bed of a river which they had drained off.
He worked a month at the river scarcely making
two dollars a day, while the man who bought his
first place, had accumulated several thousands. I
have heard fifty such stories, but as a whole this
country will pay the laborer and the mechanic
better than the miners, unless the latter have capital.
Had we come my route and reached here
with a hundred mules, a fortune could soon have
been made by packing. But, alas! against my
better judgment I allowed myself to be swayed by
Col. Webb, who had his own way at the cost of
twenty-seven thousand dollars, thirteen lives, and
the loss of many months to all the men who came
through.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chinese Diggings. February 1st, 1850.</i> Friday,
and a most beautiful day; birds all around are in
gay chatter, and the song of the raven, jay-like, but
sweet to listen to, from the attempt at softness, as
he nods and bows with swelling throat to his mate.
It is like March in Louisiana. Alas for the poor
fellows who have left the southern states to come
to this, and settle here as farmers; to be drowned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
out in winter, and burnt up in summer! However,
when the excitement of the gold fever ceases, as
it must, California will find its level with the other
states, and many a hastily made fortune will be as
rapidly lost.
</p>

<p>
I am leaving for the North Fork of the Stanislaus,
twenty-five miles, to make one more effort to
keep the company together and to pay off our
indebtedness to the stockholders, but I fear my
efforts will be useless.
</p>

<p>
<i>Murphy's Diggings. Sunday, February 10.</i>
Everything seems against us—weather and season,
water and rain, interrupt us in all our attempts at
work, and ill-luck seems to follow us. After fruitless
labor at the Chinese Diggings I came here,
where the diggings are said to be very rich, but
where we have to wait for the waters to subside,
perhaps two months, and I have not the means to
keep the men for that length of time, even if the
date of their contract did not expire before then.
</p>

<p>
These diggings are said to be the richest in the
southern mining district and here I came to make
my last effort for the good of my men; for myself
my home is awaiting me, and ample means to pay
off all the indebtedness I have personally incurred;
many times a day I thank God I never asked one
man to join the venture, though I feel strongly
that some, notably Clement, Walsh, Boden, poor
fellow, my cousin Howard Bakewell, and a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
others joined because I did. Knowing this, and
knowing too how many have risked their all, I
hesitate to leave, as long as I feel I can be of help
in any way, and shall go into the matter very
carefully with the men, most of whom however I
know feel as I do.
</p>

<p>
<i>February 25th, 1850.</i> Today we all met together
and after much serious talk, I told the men
that their time was more than up, and that, consequently
they were their own masters and the company
dissolved. I told them, too, that I was ready
to help each and all to the best of my ability, poor
enough, but I believed we could do better in other
ways than mining. Not a word was said, and
silently all went to their tents; we had been a year
together, in sickness and trouble, in boisterous
mirth and sorrowful anxiety, and like old and tried
friends we felt the coming separation keenly; we
were all greatly depressed. I shall be with the men
for some weeks, and shall then try to make up for
part of what I have lost, making drawings and
sketches, and collecting such specimens as I can. I
am bitterly disappointed for the men who have
been so faithful, and who have stood by me so
staunchly, but as Tone said to me some hours after
our talk: "There's more money to be made here by
land speculations, and every kind of work than
there is in mining, and those who work will get on."
I quite agree with him, and when one hears of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
return of men with large fortunes, ask if speculations
in land or trade, bar-keeping or Monte
dealing has not swollen the first few hundreds, dug
and gained with hard labor, privation, or, in rare
cases, wonderful luck. Even then for one man who
has a thousand, there are hundreds who will not
average a tenth of it after expenses are paid.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 6th.</i> Again on the road from Stockton
east, towards the mines. I have been to San Francisco
and am now on my way to join Layton to
begin my tour of the mining and agricultural
districts of this now most fairy-like country, everything
so smiling and beautiful, flowers of the
smaller varieties by thousands; and the snow
melting sends its waters down all the little rills and
rivulets clear and pure, giving freshness and luxuriance
to the whole country; could it retain so much
beauty through the summer, I should pronounce
it, at once, the most enchanting land I had ever
seen, and yet, as I think of the beautiful shrubs of
the east, and where they do exist, of the magnolias,
wild roses, and flowering vines and trees we have,
I think the countries balanced, for here two species
of oak, three pines, the redwood and the laurel,
will almost enumerate the whole of the common
varieties of trees.
</p>

<p>
Farther south, back of San Diego, in the valley
of Santa Maria, I saw the finest sycamores I have
ever come across; they grow where they have room
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
enough to extend their gigantic limbs laterally,
instead of forcing their huge trunks in rivalry with
the oaks, to get fresh air and sunshine.
</p>

<p>
The country from Stockton is a clayey flat, so
little of an inclination to the land, that the water
appears to lie until evaporated, and the "sloughs"
in many places are sluggish and seem to be more
water-holes than running streams, until they reach
the Calaveras, which is a beautiful creek nearly
dry four months of the year, but the other eight
giving good water. The meadow-like flats about
it look just ready for the plough, though by using
that, a sward of good grass would be lost. The
country from here becomes very gradually more
and more undulating, changing the nature of the
soil every few miles. In some places the hills
are of clay, and valleys of greyish loam, or red
sand thickly mixed in with quartz; in many cases
water-worn, but all is so beautiful that were the
woods more dense, and the water-courses now so
inviting, "never-failing," the farmer would here
find his Paradise, and by selecting his land so as
to avoid the gravelly sub-soil, which is too abundant
for richness, and choosing that which has the
clay foundation, his plantation might be one of
great permanence, for the rains here do not wash
off much of the soil.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 8th.</i>   Following up one of the north
forks of the Calaveras, we passed through beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
valleys, green and luxuriant, but very short
stretches of grass; the hills, at times, so close
together at the base that the valley was almost lost;
but the ascent was rapid, and we found ourselves
soon on the singular hills of this country within
a mile of the Mokolumne [Mokelumme] mines,
where we camped for the night.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 9th, 1850.</i> The ice this morning was
half an inch thick, and the cold at day-light,
intense. One hour after sunrise, the day began to
be summer, and at nine o'clock our coats were off,
and we were riding towards the beautiful view
made by the interesting lines of Mokolumne hill
and its adjacent fellows, all eccentric, and all interesting.
</p>

<p>
The soil in the ravines here is mostly clay, but
from time to time partakes of the sandy red clay
so common in this country, resembling very much
the gravelly hills of the post-oaks of Texas. The
ride up the stream to "Mokolumne rich gulch,"
is very interesting, passing between two hills, or
lines of hills, with occasional ravines leading down
to the creek we were following.
</p>

<p>
We passed an Indian village of six huts; the
squaws were pounding acorns to make "payote,"
in natural mortars, formed by the slight indentations
being used constantly; the pounding of the
stone (small granite boulders, water-worn smooth),
sometimes wear the holes a foot deep; but they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
are generally deserted before that depth is reached.
A smooth, flat stone is usually preferred by the
Indians to begin on, and if the country suits their
purposes, and the lodges remain any length of
time in the neighborhood, the stone is often marked
with thirty or forty of these mortar holes.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] Leaving "Rich gulch," we took a
southerly course over the ridge, and wound down
the branches of the Calaveras, until the various
rivulets united and formed what is called the
"north branch of the Calaveras." Where we
crossed, it was about eighteen inches deep, and
runs over a rough bed of various-sized pebbles,
with larger lumps of granite and quartz for the
horses to stumble over, making the ford when the
stream is muddy from recent rains, very treacherous.
The soil is of the same character for a
mile or two, occasionally of a reddish loam, containing
both clay and sand, mixed with gravel, of
angular formation, very small, and with more or
less quartz, equally various as to the size and quantity
of the pieces.
</p>

<p>
The pits dug by the miners at the Chinese Diggings,
five miles from the Tuolome [Tuolumne]
River, and midway between the mountains and
plains, among the hills, present ordinarily a superficial
loam of from six to eighteen inches, rich, at
times, but again of the light bluish clay; the next
stratum is of reddish clay and gravel, and very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
hard, ending in slatey rock, soft and dead to pick
at, and having the usual friability of the trap slate
that is so plentiful all over the country, sticking
up in places like the headstones of a deserted
churchyard. At Wood's Diggings the same
appearance is seen, but with the slate in more
upright strata and hard.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 18th.</i> At Murphy's New Diggings, the
gulch is full of lumps of granite and heavy gravel;
in the part called "The Flat" in the lower part of
the valley the soil is of great depth, in places eight
to ten feet, less in others.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 20th.</i> From Murphy's New Diggings
to Angel's Camp is six miles; the country just
undulating, inviting the squatter to put up his log
house, made from the few pines that, from time
to time, form little clusters, but so far apart as
always to arrest the attention, and call forth the
admiration of the wanderer through these lonely
hills, where the want of woods to me gives more
solitude than our densest forest; so much for habit,
for I recollect well that "Beaver," my Delaware
Indian guide in Texas, always was anxious for
the prairie, whenever I took him into the deep
swamps of the Brasos or Guadaloupe.
</p>

<p>
"Angel's Diggings" is one of the many repetitions
of the same thing seen every day. A beautiful
little brook, with precipitous sides, and gravelly
or rocky beds; high hills of red clayey loam, mixed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
or sprinkled with bits of quartz and slate, forming
continual amphitheatres at almost every bend
of the creek. Here I met a gentleman who had,
for many years, been washing gold in the Carolinas;
he had a quicksilver machine of his own
invention, price one thousand dollars, which he
was working with six men. He told me he was
getting a pound a day from the sands he was washing,
which had been washed already in the
common rocker. He did not feel so sure of its
efficacy in the clay diggings, but for sand it certainly
was admirable. These diggings like all I
have seen that were worth anything were completely
riddled; first by the top washing, and "dry"
washing of the Mexicans, then by the hurried,
superficial "panning out" of the lucky American
who came first and reaped his fortune; next better
dug out by the gold digger for his three ounces
a day, and now toil and hard labor gave the strong
determined washer from small amounts to, occasionally,
an ounce a day, when the water will permit
him to work.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 23d.</i> Our road to Cayote [Coyote]
made a "V" from Murphy's, over a poor soil, with
nothing of interest along the six miles but a small
elevation of semi-basaltic sand-stone, mixed with
granite, with large particles of crystal-like spar.
</p>

<p>
The approach to Cayote is down a red clay hill,
of course, and is on a point made by two little rivers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
(I should call them streams) which meet at the
lower end of the diggings. The larger one is
called the Cayote River, a branch of the north
fork of the Stanislaus, and the diggings are about
ten miles up if you follow the windings of the
creek, but by the road only five to the Stanislaus.
</p>

<p>
The first year these diggings were worked many
large amounts of gold were dug here with little
labor; the second year required harder labor for
poorer results, and it is its early reputation that
keeps it up, though some holes are still paying
well; I was told four, out of the fifty then being
worked. The largest amount taken in the time I
have been here, two days, was found by five
Englishmen, two pounds and three ounces; others
are well content with an ounce a day and do not
give up their holes if much less than that is the
result of ten hours or more work.
</p>

<p>
There are a few Indians near this place; poor,
miserable devils, dirty and half clothed, for they
have given up buckskin for Mexican blankets, their
faces begrimed with dirt and their whole appearance
one of neglect and filth. They dig a little
gold from time to time and leave a good share of
it with a French trader, Poillon by name. He
makes his trade pay by giving them presents in
the morning to secure their good-will, and a little
extra change at night, on his provisions. I saw
him selling the lowest part of a leg from the forequarter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
of a very poor beef at an abominable price,
and he turned to me with a pitiful expression, and
asked if he ought to let it go for so small a price,
showing me an ounce of gold. All Indian trading
appears to be done in the same way, make them
presents, and then charge double the value of the
gift, on the first article they buy.
</p>

<p>
The food of these Indians is chiefly the "payote"
made from the acorns into a kind of gruel, rather
astringent to the taste of the white man, but to an
Indian digestion all seems good that can be swallowed.
</p>

<p>
I saw a papoose, too small to walk, with a stone
in his hand half as big as his head, shelling out
the nuts of the pine-cone, cracking and eating them
with the judgment of a monkey, and looking very
much like one.
</p>

<p>
Their wigwams faced the south, and formed an
irregular cluster of bark and mud cones; the usual
number of fox- and wolf-like dogs gave the same
effect that I am accustomed to, but the tribe is not
as handsome as the Indians of the east, or
even the Yumas, Pimos, or the Maricopas on
the Gila.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Cayote diggings, the trail for five miles
passes between two moderately high ridges to
Carson's Creek, where the soil changes to a much
poorer quality; crossing the creek we ascended a
fairly high hill, from which I took a sketch across
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
the Stanislaus. The sunset effect was fine, but
I had no colors with me.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 25th.</i> After crossing the Stanislaus we
ascended a long hill leading about southwest,
towards the "Mormon Gulch" three miles distant.
The road wound up ravines for the first
two miles, and would have made as beautiful a
walk as it did a ride. All nature was still and
calm, and the silent scene brought Sunday to both
our minds, and we agreed that whether in the
wilderness, or at home, the day brought a feeling
of tranquillity. We almost changed our minds
when we reached the diggings, so different was
the scene. The bar-rooms were all doing a
"thriving business," and the monte dealers were
doing even a better, gloating over the hard-earned
piles of gold dust which ought to have served a
better purpose.
</p>

<p>
Passing all this, and going up a beautiful
gorge, winding at times so as almost to form a
semi-circle, we turned our course, and came upon
a most exquisite cascade; the water split upon a
bold rock about fifty feet high and tumbled in
leaps of from six to ten feet until it reached the
rocky bed, where it rushed on boiling and bubbling
impetuously until it joined the Stanislaus.
</p>

<p>
Our walk to Wood's Creek was hot and tiresome,
and after cooling off we took a sponge bath, the
water being too cold for a plunge, and then sauntered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
about looking for the best points at which
to take views of this most beautiful part of the
country. Situated, by comparison, in a basin, and
straggling up and down the creek are here situated
Wood's diggings, Jamestown and Yorktown. The
soil looks poor, and the rock is granite and sandstone
with some slate. On the high points and
peaks of "Table Mountain" huge masses of conglomerate
boulders, two feet and more in diameter,
are scattered everywhere, and give a dreary look
to all the north side of Wood's diggings. The
hill to the west has shot up into beautiful obelisks
of quartz, and you only cease to admire it to be in
raptures over the views seen by turning east, to
look over mountain beyond mountain, snowy peaks
bare of trees, and between them the rounded points
of hills, looking tiny by comparison. To the
south, bold, rounded but high mountains, full of
verdure and with most graceful outlines, enchant
you, while the verdant stretches at the foot of these
mountains have a pastoral air which made us think
of home.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 27th.</i> My day passed in a vain attempt
to transfer to canvas the scene before our tent;
when I had worked some hours I went into the
tent next to ours, where lies a poor man, ill, pale,
dejected, unable to move even a few steps. His
mud roof leaks, the soil forming the side of his
cabin is so porous that it admits such quantities of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
water that a ditch is necessary to carry it off from
the dirt floor. This man came round the Horn,
and the long voyage and poor food left him such a
victim of scurvy that since he arrived in California,
the first of last October, he has worked only six
days; the relative with whom he came, and who
has toiled for both, has only been able to keep them
in provisions, with his best endeavors; he has no
money to get home, now his only wish. This
man is the brother of Barnum, the museum man;
he has written to him, and is awaiting a draft
which will enable him to return.
</p>

<p>
Day and night (these beautiful moonlight
nights), flock after flock of wild geese pass almost
hourly over our heads to the north. I give up in
despair trying to fathom the use of their migration,
when hundreds of their fellows are known to breed
so far south. Their courtship is kept up as they
fly high over the grassy plains where they fed last
fall, for if you look closely at the flock, you will
see that with the exception of the old gander, a
fourth larger than the others, as a rule all the rest
are in pairs, and the males follow the females so
closely that the line is composed of two very near
together, two a little distance from them, and so
on to the end.
</p>

<p>
<i>March 28th.</i> Wood's diggings having given
me such sketches as I could take, we took the
valley road to Chinese diggings, en route for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
Hawkin's [Hawkins's] bar, on the Tuolomne. We
were assured before we left that "Woods" now only
giving five dollars at the most to good workers,
once gave as many ounces, and is now kept up on its
past reputation by the storekeepers, as all prospectors
must pay something; one takes a drink,
another some fresh meat, another a pair of boots;
all is sold at exorbitant prices, and storekeepers get
rich if no one else does. We are now leaving
Layton for Sonora Camp, and I, for Hawkin's
Bar.
</p>

<p>
Every turn gives some vista of beauty in this
Garden of Eden; the soft southerly breeze is perfumed
with the delicate odor of millions of the
smaller varieties of prairie flowers, in some places
so abundant as to color acres, whole hillsides, so
thickly as to hide the ground, and my mule had to
eat flowers rather than grass. One without home
ties might well feel all his days could be passed in
the beauties of these valleys, roseate yellow and
blue, so soft that the purest sky cannot surpass the
color for delicacy. Tangled masses of vines climb
everywhere, hiding the hard surfaces of the quartz
rocks, and beyond this exquisite vegetation always
some view, wild and impressive, meets the eye.
</p>

<p>
But to facts: Bob Layton says: "Don't bring
your wagons through Chinese Diggings;" and I
agree with him, unless you have nine yoke of
pretty good oxen to your load of three thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
five hundred pounds. I believe that teams such as
these do get about three miles a day across the
boggy flat and post-oak quicksands of these diggings.
(In many places the body of the luggage
wagon is six inches deep in the mud.) This condition
lasts from December to March inclusive.
</p>

<p>
What this country must be in summer I cannot
say, but if it cracks as the soil does south of Los
Angeles, it must indeed be miserable, and the
stories of the Mexicans we met below the Colorado
must be true, when they said it was almost impassable.
</p>

<p>
A few miles on towards Hawkin's Bar on the
Tuolomne the country is very fine, and little plains
and valleys fill the six miles, all but the last one,
which is a steep descent, short and rugged, over
clay and rocks. On this ridge the grass is sparse,
and "arrow-wood" was plentiful. The day's
march over, you set up your tent, and find cool and
delicious water from the Tuolomne just as it leaves
its mountain gorge; a little creek on the left which
has taken its rise below the altitude of snow is
twenty degrees warmer, and so more welcome for
bathing purposes.
</p>

<br />
<i>April 1, 1850</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>March 29th.</i> The Tuolomne here, one mile
above Hawkin's Bar, comes out of a gorge in the
hills, which is both steep and rocky, and sends
forth the troubled stream to be tossed and dashed
over rocks and shallow bars, for miles through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
hills and chasms until it reaches the plains, when
it moves quietly, but still rapidly at this season,
as it makes its way to the San Joaquin, ninety or a
hundred miles from the mouth of that stream.
</p>

<p>
The river here rises and falls daily and nightly
almost with the regularity of the tide, not ordinarily
more than a foot or two, this being due to the
effect of the sun on the snows of the mountains;
the warmer the day the higher the water. At
night many men in parties of from twenty-five to
fifty are here engaged in digging canals to drain
the bed of the river at low water. I learn however
that they are greatly hindered in this by numerous
springs in the bottom of the river, and
though there is no doubt a great deal of gold, the
difficulties of getting it without machinery are
more than can be realized by any one who has not
been here and tried.
</p>

<p>
The buzzards in this upper country are just
pairing. I have seen three or four couples of the
California vulture but have not secured one yet.
</p>

<p>
The bar which was dug here last year is now
under water, but I am told it was very profitable
and many made five or six thousand from their
summer's work. There are many here waiting for
the plains to dry and snows to melt, when Hawkin's
celebrated bar may again be worked. While I
am here, I may as well try to give an idea of how
the work is done. When a spot has been selected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
the digger opens a pit, ordinarily four to six feet
deep, but sometimes only the top soil has to be
removed before the digger can commence washing;
this depends on whether he comes to soil
tenacious enough to hold the gold, and keep it
from sinking down through light, sandy, or porous
soils, until it meets with a formation which prevents
it from going deeper into the earth. Sometimes
in such places are found large deposits
called "pockets," and doubtless there are still many
to be discovered. When suitable soil is found the
digger takes a panful for washing, and with doubt
and anxiety goes to the nearest water to see if his
"hole" will pay. He stirs the earth and sand in
his pan around, until all the soluble part floats off
over the sides of the pan, which is kept under
water; he then begins shaking backwards and forwards
with a regular movement what is left in
his pan, to settle what gold is in it; the gold sinks
and all the lighter gravel is tipped to the sides,
and the gold is quite below all except the black
sand, so like emery that when the gold is very fine
it is a great drawback, and difficult to separate.
Should the digger find gold enough to warrant
his washing the clay at the bottom of his pit, and
thereby gaining half an ounce a day he goes on
washing, but grumbles at his hard luck, hoping
that as he gets deeper in his hole he will get richer
also, and that when he comes to rock, he may find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
a "pocket." The cradle is set up, the water poured
over, and the monotony of the digger's life begins,
a sort of voluntary treadmill occupation, until
homesick and tired, even if successful, he ties up
his wallet which contains his wealth, secretes it
about his body, and tramps off. A man who is
usually successful, and there are not so many, may
have acquired five or six thousand dollars, but he
has usually aged ten years.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 5th.</i> Leaving Hawkin's Bar for Green
Springs, we sauntered along the trail under the
beautiful post-oaks, just now in their greatest
beauty, with leaves half-grown and pendant catkins.
Now we shot a partridge or a hare, or
stopped to let "Riley," our pack mule, luxuriate in
some little patch of rich grass, in which he stood
knee deep. Overhead we saw the heavy, sweeping
motion of the vulture's wing, or watched his
silent circles. Around us are flowers innumerable,
brilliant, soft, modest, fragrant, to suit all
fancies, till, having finished our eight-mile journey,
the sun began to cast its evening light over the
landscape, for we had started late. Layton had
rejoined me, and we set up our tent and I made
a sketch.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 6th.</i> Four o'clock found us on our way
back to Hawkin's, to meet a friend of Layton's,
N. Howard, who was to be our companion. It
was cloudy but beautiful, and at Wedgewood's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
tent we found our friend, and shelter, of which
we were glad, as rain was beginning to fall and
soon came down in torrents, swelling the little
brook near the tents to a roaring stream.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 8th.</i> After being delayed by rain, our
trio started for Don Pedro's Bar, eight miles down
the Tuolomne. The country to look at is most
beautiful, and our short walk was one of pleasure
and admiration.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 9th.</i> This morning we crossed the river
and after a trot of about five miles came to the
cañon. I made my way to the lower end called
Indian Bluff and my sketch was finished by probably
five o'clock; but having no watch I cannot
tell. Here I saw the nests of the California vulture,
but on the opposite side of the river, now an
impassable torrent.
</p>

<p>
The country on the south side of this river,
where we are, is very hilly, the soil tolerable, and
the trees still post-oak. We leave for Stockton
tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 10th.</i> The road was pleasant on our way
back to Green Springs and for a mile further, and
when evening came we pitched our "line" tent,
and commenced cooking our supper. We had a
California hare, a mallard and a plover, all killed
out of season, but food we must have. Howard
boasted of his coffee, Layton is the baker of the
mess, whilst I parboiled my slices of pork to rid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
it of its coarse flavor, fried out the lard, and have
turned and re-turned the loin and hindlegs of our
hare. "Riley" safely tethered near us had an
equally good supper of the grass and flowers that
were to be his bed, and we spread our blankets
and went to sleep, or rather the other two have
done so, and I, writing by the firelight, shall soon
follow their example.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 11th.</i> Our road today was almost the
same that I had travelled with the company going
from Stockton to Chinese Camp or diggings, but
how changed the scene. The road then was soft
mud and mire for miles; now it is as hard as brick,
and the hills then scarcely tinged with green by the
early sprouting vegetation are now fresh and
beautiful with every shade of green and brilliant
flowers of all colors. At every rise of ground we
paused and turned to look back at the range of the
Sierra Nevada softening and mellowing in the
hazy light of the sun, the brilliancy enhanced by
the deepening blue of the distant hills which form
the last outline on the eastern horizon.
</p>

<p>
Here I tried my hand again at oil painting for
landscape, but can only blot in what will answer
hereafter to give me local color. After painting
about three hours we packed up and started again,
as there was no water near us, and took our direction
westerly. We found the beds of the streams
that in January were beautiful little rivulets, now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
bright sand bleaching in the sun, their waters dried
up or only a tiny trickle. As we descended from
one table land to another the rich vegetation
became broken by spots of barrenness, and at times
whole plains of weeds, not strong and rank showing
fertile land, but coarse, noxious, ungainly with
disgusting smell, extended for three or four miles
and we followed the dusty road almost feeling
that we were again on our terrible journey through
Mexico last summer.
</p>

<p>
All these valleys along the river look more fertile
in winter than at this season, as the wet and
moisture gives the appearance of richness, which
is now completely dissipated by the already
parched-up effect of the land.
</p>

<p>
To give you some little idea of the changes
occurring in this country: the ferry we crossed last
winter (and could only be taken over after great
bargaining for a dollar each), we crossed today,
all three of us, and our mule for the same sum of
one dollar. So at the mines, the same change has
taken place; last year an ounce was considered the
average of the produce of good working men per
diem; this year half an ounce is considered the
average, by equally good and better skilled workmen.
The people at home will not believe that
the roads are travelled by a continuous line of
miners; some on foot, some with packs, mules,
wagons, in search of "better luck."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The snows are melting so fast just now that the
river is within two feet of being as high as when
I crossed in the winter just after two nights of rain;
then it was muddy, and anyone could see was not
in a natural state, now though almost as rapid and
deep its clear waters do not give the angry look it
had then—so much for summer and its softening
effects.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The road from Stanislaus over broad prairies of
poor sandy soil extends for miles until nearing
the edge of the line of beautiful old oaks that
fringe French Creek and its swamps; then the
earth becomes richer and sends up a growth of
clover and beautiful grass knee high, until you
reach Stockton. Indeed all the best lands of the
San Joaquin River are admirably suited for planting
with proper drainage and cultivation.
</p>

<p>
The sea breeze at this season is cold and searching,
keeping the thermometer at 60 degrees and
62 degrees for days; when a lull comes the heat
is at once oppressive, and the mercury rises to
80 degrees or 85 degrees, and the heat dances
before us almost in palpable shapes; the water all
stagnant sends its odor of decaying vegetation
everywhere, accompanied by myriads of mosquitoes.
These conditions exist for miles over the
east side, towards the mountains of the San Joaquin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>April 16th.</i> I am still at Stockton making
various excursions with Layton and his friend
Howard from New Orleans, and sketching constantly
and steadily. I am indeed crowding all
sail to start for home on the steamer which sails on
June 1st, with Capt. Patterson. I have made
nearly ninety careful sketches, and many hasty
ones, the most interesting I have been able to find
in these southern mines, and expect to leave in a
few days for Sacramento.
</p>

<p>
<i>Stockton, April 18th.</i> I am hardly fit to write
for I have just had most melancholy news from
Simson. Lieut. Browning, my dear and devoted
friend; to whom I owe a debt of gratitude which
I can never pay, for his friendship and kindness to
me last year, from the hour that he took my hand
on the accursed Rio Grande River until we parted
in San Francisco, has been drowned. With Lieuts.
Bache and Blunt he was examining the coast near
Trinidad Bay, and on attempting to land, the boat
"broached to" in the breakers and capsized. Five
were drowned, among them Lieuts. Browning and
Bache. Thus is added another victim to our
ill-fated expedition. Strange that from first to
last we have been so fatally followed. Night
after night Browning and I shared the same tent,
the same blankets; we knew each [other] well, we
were friends.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<i>April 23d.</i> The whole country to the north and
east of Stockton through to the Calaveras is most
rich and splendid soil, but in many places too low
for farming, but the grazing was excellent, quantities
of wild oats, rye grass (I think), clover and
a species resembling red-top. In many places the
grasses were breast high as I waded through them
but generally full knee-deep. As we neared the
Calaveras we lost our way trying to avoid some
bad arroyos, and followed a trail off to the eastward,
perhaps three miles, and the country if
changed at all, changed for the better. Finding
the trend of the trail we were following did not
suit our ideas of direction, we turned back at even
more than a right angle, and in half an hour
entered a wood of open timber, with here and
there a lagoon or quagmire of mud and mire; but
we worked through and Layton went ahead to
reconnoitre, and in about twenty minutes reported
the river, which we followed down on a good firm
cattle trail, and in half an hour more had come to
the upper settlement of the ferry, and were stopped
by the fences of newly made farms, and again
driven to the swamps to get only a few hundred
yards down to the ferry.
</p>

<p>
We crossed the river after having assisted some
Germans with about six hundred sheep, and
camped for the night tired enough, having made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
only about ten miles, but walked nearly twenty of
hard travel.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 24th.</i> As the traveller leaves the north
side of the Calaveras and rises higher, the ground
becomes cold and has a bluish-looking clay for the
road, almost as hard as soft brick, and more
tenacious; there are streaks of sandy soil, and in a
few places good land; this is scarce however,
between the Calaveras and Mokulumne where the
Sacramento road crosses the plain. The last three
miles of the road is through a pleasant, half-wooded
country of live-oak and a few varieties
of other shrubs, for the whole of the wood is
small.
</p>

<p>
The sandy road was a great relief to us after
the lumpy one of the morning, and we tramped
merrily on, until we reached the Mokulumne, and
saw a comfortable (for this country), log and jacal
built house, and passing about two hundred yards
further on, spread our blankets under some half
dozen magnificent oaks, and after washing away
the dust and heat in the clear, cold little river, very
rapid but smooth, ate our lunch of fried pork and
bread, and stretched ourselves out to rest for an
hour, when we packed up, and being ferried across
in a pretty good flat-boat, the only one between
Stockton and Sacramento, we continued our walk
to Dry Creek over just the same description of
country we had had in the morning; but it became
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
more sandy if anything, and towards evening was
more of a rolling country. Before we camped for
the night we swam "Riley" across a creek about
twenty feet wide, and paid one dollar and fifty
cents for ourselves and belongings to cross in a sort
of canoe, which took us about five minutes.
</p>

<p>
At the ferry house was a comfortable looking
woman with four little children, one an infant;
like the Texans she told us they had plenty of cattle,
but only one milch cow, so we went on.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 25th.</i> This morning mounting a slight
rise of ground we at once found ourselves on a high
dry, too dry, prairie, facing a bracing northwest
wind, just strong enough to feel it stirring up our
spirits, and we went cheerily on for about eight
miles to a bridge, crossed it, and for about two
miles had a succession of sloughs to cross, some
boggy, some quicksand, others we had to swim.
By carefully sounding we kept our packs dry in
crossing, and safely reached the back of Murphy's
corral, where I skinned a magpie I had shot, and
Layton took a nap. We then went to admire Mr.
Murphy's fine stock of brood mares, and the young
horses he is raising. At three in the afternoon we
packed and left for Sacramento City, keeping to
the road for eight miles, when we came to a wood
where we collected sufficient fuel for our evening
cooking, and went on two miles or so to a lagoon
of excellent water, and camped. We had no tent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
poles, so did as we had done often before, spread
one side of the tent on the ground and laid our
blankets on that, and covered ourselves with the
other part; a corner was put over my gun used as a
pole, which gave a place to sit, and also protected
our solitary candle from the wind, so we ate our
supper in comfort, and enjoyed a kill-deer and a
couple of snipe we had shot.
</p>

<p>
We did not hear a sound but the croakings of
hundreds of frogs from the pond by our side. Our
long campings out had accustomed us to solitudes
like this, but on our desolate, half starving march
of last year, doubt, anxiety, yes and fear, had always
taken from the complete enjoyment of such freedom
as this. The country was so flat that the
horizon was lost even in the bright moonlight, and
the perfect silence, the pure cloudless sky overhead,
the quiet little lake, tended to make everything
full of solemnity and peace.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 26th.</i> This morning half a gale was blowing
from the northwest and we were glad to wear
our blanket coats until the sun warmed up the earth.
We reached "Sutter's Fort" at noon, and lay down
under the adobe wall to take our lunch. I was
disappointed in the view I had hoped to take; here,
on a boundless plain, with two or three hospitals
around it, stands a sort of rancho, not so good in
many respects as those of New Mexico, but all in
the same style, the sides being a series of rooms,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
one corner being better fitted up for the rancher
and his family.
</p>

<p>
Under some grand old oaks three hundred feet
to the eastward, is a cemetery containing a number
of graves all made, they tell me, last year when
miners and emigrants alike succumbed to illness
brought on in many cases by exposure, poor food,
and, in some cases, doubtless by disappointed hopes.
</p>

<p>
Sacramento City is a country village built on a
flat point, between a lagoon and the river just below
the junction of American River, so low as to be
eighteen inches under average high water mark.
It has been a source of such speculations as '36
never heard of. I was shown a plot of some half-dozen
half lots, which cost last fall two hundred
and fifty dollars. The gentleman who owned
them, Dr. Pierson, told me he had sold two of
them, about a quarter of the whole, for three thousand
five hundred dollars, after holding them six
months. Truly people did come to California to
make money, and some made it, but California will
for the present lower the moral tone of all who
come here.
</p>

<p>
There are few refining influences and men
become coarse and profane in language, while the
hard life does not improve the temper; the sight
of the gold they see dug, and the fortunes they
hear of that have been made in months, some few
even in weeks, make them avaricious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Many lots of land, valued last year at one thousand
dollars, are now valued at ten thousand
dollars, but sooner or later the fall must come.
</p>

<p>
Sutter's Fort appears to have been built with
great care as to its means of defence, though at
first sight a visitor would be puzzled to know why
it was called a fort at all; closer examination shows
that it once had, from all appearances, four square
towers, some twenty-five feet high, one at each
corner, each tower mounting four, eighteen, or at
most, twenty-four pound carronades, and the
effect of these on the Indians was all that was
required for protection, for the Indians here are
a very low class and poor race, far inferior to the
eastern tribes, and like the Mexicans cowardice is
their chief trait, or at least their most prominent
one; and if Mr. Sutter could have had twenty
faithful followers, he must have been "monarch
of all he surveyed."
</p>

<p>
The swampy neighborhood, bad atmosphere,
and malarial conditions must render this section
of country unhealthy to a great degree for half the
year; for as autumn comes on the daily supply of
freshly-melted snow-water from the mountains
will no longer purify the lagoons and bayous of
the vicinity.

<p>
Fever and ague is very prevalent now, and
dysentery feared by all. Many of the farmers I
find here tell me they are only working to get
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
money enough to get back with, and that nothing
would induce them to settle here. They have
unfortunately not seen the lower part of the valley
and what lies about Los Angeles and to the southward—that
is the flower of California.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 29th.</i> Alas, is it for good or for bad
luck, that I have just learned that Layton and
myself cannot travel with safety across the country
here, as below, on account of the ill-will of the
Indians, and that a party of less than six will be
unsafe up and across the middle fork of the American
River. How stories of Indians are told to
every traveller. Though often near them, I have
never found any who were not greater cowards
than myself, and we leave today for Sutter's Mills,
Georgetown, etc., in good health and spirits.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 4th. Coloma.</i> "Sutter's Mills" is about
fifty miles [distant], nearly east of Sacramento.
The road to it after passing the first four or five
miles runs through a sandy soil, covered at present
with what we call "sneeze-weed." There is no
water, until after leaving the river, American
Fork, we crossed a pretty little "spring branch"
as it would be called in Louisiana. The grass is
sparse and poor along the whole route, and the face
of nature looks like August in the eastern states, so
completely that as the refreshing cool breezes come
to us each morning, I almost fancy it is the first of
September. But in the valleys and on the hillsides
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
the heat is most oppressive, though, as in England,
if you stand still for only a few moments in the
shade, you soon feel chilled through.
</p>

<p>
The valley here is not as wide as at Stockton by
at least twenty miles, and the grand masses of snow
covered mountains seem almost within a day of
you, whilst south you still have distance to give
additional enchantment to the view. The oaks
here are small, not more than from eighteen inches
to two feet in diameter; if the soil in which they
grew had any richness, I should say the whole
forest was of forty years growth at most, but for the
occasional presence of a grove of magnificent pines,
from a hundred to nearly two hundred feet high.
I have measured many at the angle on the ground
and have proved it with rods so that I know I am
very nearly correct in my statement.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 6th.</i> Crossing the river at Coloma, on a
good bridge, we commenced our ascent of the long
and in many places very steep hill. We found a
start at dawn would have been much better than
at ten, which it now was, as our poor mule "Riley"
felt the heat greatly; but with occasional pauses up
we went, passing wrecked wagons and broken
pack-saddles in several of the narrow parts of the
cañons that the road wound through. We were
not sorry when we found we had reached
the last hill and mounted it, hoping to be repaid
by some distant view, but on no side could we see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
more than a few miles; and we journeyed on,
wondering who would be<a name='FA_40' id='FA_40' href='#FN_40' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> at the mushroom town,
Coloma, renowned for being the place where gold
was first found by the whites.
</p>

<p>
We were told that Captain Sutter had made a
large fortune by digging gold with many of the
Indians he had about him; how true the story is,
of course, I cannot say.
</p>

<p>
[<i>No date.</i>] Starting early we had time enough
to reach Georgetown, and after the first few miles,
were pleased to see a most favorable change in the
forest we passed through. A better class of white
oaks appeared, and following up a beautiful little
creek we gradually came to a pine growth large
and magnificent; both yellow and white pine were
there, also the long coned pine, and many superb
cedars over a hundred feet high. In many places
these trees were felled, and split into laths and
joists so straight and fine that but little dressing
was requisite to fit them for the buildings here
constructed, frame houses one story high. I saw
some maples, very like what we call "soft" maple,
an elm or two, and many specimens of Nuttall's
splendid dogwood in full bloom.
</p>

<p>
The ultramarine jay is here by dozens, robins,
fly catchers, chats, finches by hundreds. I see daily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
new birds and plants that a year's steady work
could not draw, but if our government would send
good men, what a work of national pride could be
brought out! Geology, botany, entomology, zoölogy,
etc. The views are frequently superb, and
the hemlocks and pines of many species most
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
We reached Georgetown—two rows of poor
houses and sheds. The houses all one story, but
some with piazzas, and here we took our supper
at the "Pine settlement" as it is called.

A company of young men started yesterday afternoon,
who, under the command of Major H. L.
Webb and J. W. Audubon, will take the land
route via Corpus Christi, Monterey, etc., to the
gold regions of California. The whole company
will number one hundred. Thirty-five or forty
went from Philadelphia yesterday.
</p>

<p>
They proceed direct to Cairo, which is the rendez-vous
of the party; here they will be joined by
companies from the West. At New Orleans or
thereabouts as most convenient, they will purchase

mules, horses and all necessary equipments, each
man finding his own outfit.

to mention the recrossing. The crossing of the Colorado was
just below the mouth of the Gila. Lieut. Whipple was making
observations at this point at this time. Fort Yuma was

list, here reprinted from the New York "Evening Express,"
contains seventy-five names but does not claim to be complete.
Apparently a number of men from Philadelphia, but
not as many as stated above, joined the company, since it is repeatedly
described as "at one time numbering ninety-eight."
The implication in the <i>Journal</i> that there were but sixty-five
at Cairo must be an error. About fifty started from Roma
with Mr. Audubon but the number reached fifty-seven at
Parras. One subsequently died, another remained at Mapimi,
three left the company at Ures, eleven took the boat from San
Diego and "about forty" continued the march to Los Angeles.
This seems to have been the number of the reunited company
in San Francisco, of whom thirty-eight, including Mr. Audubon,
made the tour of the southern mines.

AN UNPUBLISHED
MS.
</p>

<p>
This hitherto unpublished MS., which is a
real literary and historical find, was written
in 1817-18 by a young Englishman of excellent education
who assisted Morris Birkbeck in establishing his Illinois
settlement. The author writes anonymously, but by a
careful study of various allusions in the <i>Narrative</i> and
from information furnished by the family in possession
of the MS., has been identified as Elias Pym Fordham.
Landing at Baltimore, he reached the West by way of
Philadelphia, Pittsburg, and the Ohio River to Cincinnati,
describing the people and the country as he went along.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MIDDLE
WEST IN 1817
</p>

<p>
Fordham was an especially well-qualified
observer of the Middle West because of
the numerous journeys he undertook, on land-hunting
trips for new emigrants, in the service of Mr. Birkbeck.
These journeys led him into Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky;
and he never omits the opportunity to make frank and
pointed comment on society, manners, and morals, as well
as careful observations of the face of the country and of
industrial conditions. The style is quite unaffected and
has much natural charm and sprightliness; and the fact
that he wrote anonymously made him much more free in
his comments on contemporary society than would otherwise
have been possible.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">LOCAL AND
PIONEER
HISTORY
</p>

<p>
These journeys also gave him unexampled
opportunities for contact with the pioneers
of the Middle West, and his journal is consequently
rich in <i>personalia</i> of early settlers, remarks on
contemporary history and politics, state of trade, agriculture,
prices, and information on local history not obtainable
elsewhere. He also visited the larger cities and gives
very interesting accounts of Pittsburg and Cincinnati, accompanied
by original sketches and plans. In Kentucky
he had the opportunity to study slavery; and although at
first prejudiced against this institution he finally reached
the conclusion that the slave states offered better chances
of successful settlement than the free states.

Pigafetta's Account, the fullest
and best authority for the famous Voyage
of Magellan, is here completely presented
in English for the first time. Pigafetta
was an Italian of noble family,
interested in navigation and fond of
travel. Happening to be in Spain when
Magellan was about to sail, he secured permission to
accompany the expedition. Pigafetta kept a detailed
account of the incidents of the voyage and faithfully
recorded his observations on the geography, climate,
and resources of the numerous strange countries visited
or described to him. Of especial value are his
remarks on the customs, physical character, and languages
of the various peoples of South America, and
the Ladrones, Philippines and other Asiatic Islands.
</p>

<p>
Pigafetta's Account, notwithstanding its great importance
to students, has never been adequately published.
Stanley, in his translation for the Hakluyt
Society, omits many passages relating to the manners
and customs of native peoples, mis-translates other
passages; and furthermore does not translate from
the original Italian, but in part from a defective
French MS. of later date, and in part from Amoretti's
garbled printed edition of the Ambrosian MS.
</p>

<p>
The MS. which we use is the oldest in existence
and is conserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana at
Milan. This MS. was purported to have been published
in 1800 by Amoretti, but his publication was
what the Italians call a <i>refacimento</i>, in which the
order is entirely changed at times to say nothing of
the meaning. To insure a correct version of the text,
the editor, Mr. Robertson, visited Milan and undertook
the transcription personally.
</p>

<p>
The numerous charts of the original are carefully
reproduced, together with a rare early map, showing
Magellan's discoveries in the Far East. To preserve
the archaic forms and peculiar letters of the old
Italian, type has been specially designed and cut for
many peculiar characters. The editing and annotation

<p class="sidenote"><i>A valuable

</p>

<p>
Pittman's <i>Mississippi Settlements</i> contains much valuable original material
for the study of the French and Spanish
Settlements of old Louisiana, West Florida, and
the Illinois country. The author, Captain Philip
Pittman, was a British military engineer, and
gives an accurate general view of the Mississippi Settlements just after
the English came into possession of the eastern half of the valley by
the Peace of 1763. His account, written from personal observation,
is rich in allusions to the political, social, and military readjustments
resulting from this change of possession. "A comprehensive account
of the Illinois country and its inhabitants, with sketches in detail of
the several French posts and villages situated therein, as personally

Dr. William F. Poole in Winsor's <i>Narrative and Critical History of
America</i> says: "It is the earliest English
account of those settlements, and, as an
authority in early western history, is of the
highest importance. He [Pittman] was a
military engineer, and for five years was employed in surveying the
Mississippi River and exploring the western country. The excellent
plans which accompany the work, artistically engraved on copper,
add greatly to its value."

"<i>This new series of historical and geographical works by the scholarly
editor of 'The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents,' promises to be
particularly valuable and of more than usual popular interest. All the
books are rare, some of them exceedingly so, no copy being found in the
largest collections on this side of the Atlantic, or in many abroad. They
are copiously explained and illustrated by introductions and notes, biographical
sketches of the authors, bibliographical data, etc.</i> <b>The series
should, of course, be in every public, collegiate, and institutional
library, to say nothing of private collections of
respectable rank.</b> <i>The works included naturally vary in literary
merit and attractiveness, but many of them will compare favorably
with the better class of modern books of travel, while some are as fascinating
as the best fiction.</i>"—The Critic.

Extracts from a few of the reviews
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="phanging">
<i>American Historical Review:</i> "The books are handsomely bound and printed.
The editing by Dr. Thwaites seems to have been done with his
customary care and knowledge. There is no want of helpful annotations.
<b>The books therefore are likely to be of more real value than the
early prints from which they are taken.</b>"
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>The Independent:</i> "The editor's annotations make the present series worth
possessing, even if one already owns the originals."
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>The Literary Digest:</i> "<b>It is next to impossible, at this late date,
even to a well-endowed public library, to amass a considerable
collection of these early travels, so essential</b> to an adequate
understanding of the life and manners of the aborigines, and the social and
economic conditions in the middle and far West, during the period of
early American settlement. The making of a judicious and competent
selection of the best and rarest of these writings has become <b>an inevitable
requirement</b>; and the patient company of historians, librarians,
and scholars will be quick to congratulate each other that the great task
has fallen to the hands of so well-equipped an editor as Dr. Thwaites,
eminent as an authority on all questions pertaining to the exploration and
development of our great Western domain."
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>The Forum:</i> "A most helpful contribution to the study of the America of a
century or so ago."
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>The Athenæum:</i> "... A series of permanent historical value ... <b>It ought
to find a place in every geographical or historical library.</b>"
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>Public Opinion:</i> "The century that sets the bounds of this work is the most
important and interesting in the history of the 'winning of the West;' ...
it is comprehensive, and the materials at the disposal of the editor assure a
collection that will be <b>indispensable to every well-equipped public
or private library</b>."
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>The Nation:</i> "A stately series, octavo in size, typographically very open and
handsome. <b>The annotations are abundant and highly valuable.</b>"
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>New York Times Saturday Review:</i> "An invaluable series of reprints of
rare sources of American history."
</p>

<p class="phanging">
<i>The Dial:</i> "<b>An undertaking of great interest to every student of
Western history.</b> Exhaustive notes and introductions are by Dr.
Thwaites, the foremost authority on Western history, who is also to supply
an elaborate analytical index, under one alphabet, to the complete
series. This latter is an especially valuable feature, as almost all the rare
originals are without indexes."

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
